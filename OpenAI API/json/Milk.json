cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and other dairy products are ubiquitous, consumed by more than 6 billion people worldwide.\nWWF is working to limit that impact, improve sustainable production practices, scale up innovative technologies, and cut waste.\nAmount of milk produced by cows, buffalo, and other livestock worldwide in 2017.\nThe US, which produces the most cow\u2019s milk, is next, at

on the way to meeting the goals of the Milk Roadmap l and even ahead of environmental targets for 2010.\nDespite the fact that UHT is an acronym for Ultra Heat Treated, the energy expended during this treatment is nothing compared to the production of conventional milk with its processing, refrigeration and carting around the country.\nFortunately, dairy farmers have a vested interest in going green: they want to cut emissions if only to lower their electricity bills.\nConventional dairy farming depletes nutrients in the ground and uses huge quantities of fertilisers \u2014 fertilisers account for roughly 1% of the world's total energy consumption \u2014 which is why some people argue the green route is to go for organic milk.\nIt adds that organic herds forage more than conventional dairy farmers, suggesting less feed - including soya - needs to be imported for organic milk.\nReader Ann Gee emailed me to say she's switched to organic milkbut it comes in a plastic carton as opposed to her old glass milk bottle.\nWhen I asked around at the time of the plastic jug launch, packaging expert Rob Holdway warned that a niche product would have problems making a big impact.\nFinally, several readers have asked me about the environmental impact of non-dairy alternatives.\nUltimately, the relative impacts of non dairy milk \u2013 hemp, soya, oats, rice, almonds etc \u2013 are probably lower than the environmental footprints of dairy milk, but there aren't any conclusive evaluations to back this up yet.\nNext week I'll be looking at the environmental impact of milk and asking: how green is the white stuff?\nYesterday the government said that dairy producers were well ahead of schedule on 2010 targets to put farmland under environmental management schemes, and today the industry has linked up with the Carbon Trust to promise carbon footprint labels on future bottles of milk.\nMaybe you're a dairy farmer, an expert on packaging (see Waitrose's reusable milk bags), or just someone who drinks a lot of milk.","2":"The milk we regularly encounter at our local grocery store can easily be divided into two categories: dairy (animal-based) and dairy-free (plant-based).\nIn my opinion, the level of greenhouse gas emissions that is required with producing dairy milk is far more consequential than the degree of other environmental impacts that come with plant-based milk."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.worldwildlife.org\/magazine\/issues\/winter-2019\/articles\/milk-s-impact-on-the-environment","1":"www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2009\/aug\/07\/milk-environmental-impact","2":"brightly.eco\/the-environmental-impacts-of-different-dairy-and-dairy-free-milk\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Effects"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Milk was your first food and has been part of the human diet for thousands of years.\nIn fact, studies have shown that a glass of chocolate milk works as good as, if not better than, expensive post-workout recovery drinks.\nCalcium is essential for strong bones and teeth, making it an important part of our daily diet.\nMilk is frequently recommended as a great way to help prevent osteoporosis, or the thinning of bones in the body.\nDrinking milk daily has also been shown to reduce the progression of osteoarthritis, or inflammation of the joints, in the knees of women.\nBecause milk is a protein- and nutrient-rich food, it\u2019s easy to have too much of a good thing.\nEight ounces is considered a full serving of milk, but glasses found in most kitchens are frequently 14-16 ounces, so pay attention to how much you drink.\nAdding milk to your diet can be as simple as drinking a cold glass with your meals.\nFor instance, making oatmeal with milk nearly doubles its protein content.\nSoups are another great food for the addition of milk.","1":"Below are 5 science-backed health benefits of milk so you can decide if it\u2019s the right choice for you.\nMilk is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including \u201cnutrients of concern,\u201d which are under-consumed by many populations (3Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, it\u2019s an excellent source of protein and contains hundreds of different fatty acids, including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and omega-3s (5Trusted Source).\nThe nutritional content of milk varies, depending on factors like its fat content and the diet and treatment of the cow it came from (10Trusted Source).\nFor example, milk from cows that eat mostly grass contains significantly higher amounts of conjugated linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids (11Trusted Source).\nAlso, organic and grass-fed cow\u2019s milk contains higher amounts of beneficial antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, which help reduce inflammation and fight oxidative stress (12Trusted Source).\nMilk is considered a \u201ccomplete protein,\u201d meaning it contains all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for your body to function at an optimal level (14Trusted Source).\nDrinking milk is associated with a lower risk of age-related muscle loss in several studies.\nIn fact, higher consumption of milk and milk products has been linked to greater whole-body muscle mass and better physical performance in older adults (18Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Drinking milk has long been associated with healthy bones.\nThis is due to its powerful combination of nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, potassium, protein and (in grass-fed, full-fat dairy) vitamin K2.\nMilk is an excellent source of the nutrients your body relies on to properly absorb calcium, including vitamin D, vitamin K, phosphorus and magnesium.\nAdding milk and dairy products to your diet may prevent bone diseases like osteoporosis.\nStudies have linked milk and dairy to a lower risk of osteoporosis and fractures, especially in older adults (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, milk is a good source of protein, a key nutrient for bone health.\nEvidence suggests that eating more protein may protect against bone loss, especially in women who do not consume enough dietary calcium (27Trusted Source).\nA study in 145 three-year-old Latino children found that higher milk-fat consumption was associated with a lower risk of childhood obesity (28Trusted Source).\nAnother study including over 18,000 middle-aged and elderly women showed that eating more high-fat dairy products was associated with less weight gain and a lower risk of obesity (29Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, the conjugated linoleic acid in milk has been studied for its ability to boost weight loss by promoting fat breakdown and inhibiting fat production (32Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, many studies have associated diets rich in calcium with a lower risk of obesity.\nFor example, unsweetened yogurt made from milk contains the same amount of protein, calcium and phosphorus.\nOthers choose not to consume milk or dairy products due to dietary restrictions, health concerns or ethical reasons.\nMilk is a nutrient-rich beverage that may benefit your health in several ways.\nDrinking milk and dairy products may prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures and even help you maintain a healthy weight.\nFor those able to tolerate it, consuming high-quality milk and dairy products has been proven to provide a number of health benefits.\nEach type of milk has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on a person's diet, health, nutritional needs, or personal taste preferences.\nDairy is the best source of calcium in the diet, the main mineral in bones.","2":"One cup (240 ml) of whole cow\u2019s milk with 3.25% fat provides (1Trusted Source): Milk is a rich source of protein \u2014 providing approximately 1 gram of this nutrient in each fluid ounce (30 ml), or 7.7 grams in each cup (240 ml) (1).\nBoth of these groups of milk proteins are considered to be of excellent quality, with a high proportion of essential amino acids and good digestibility.\nOne important property of casein is its ability to increase the absorption of minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus (2Trusted Source).\nWhey proteins have been associated with many beneficial health effects, such as decreased blood pressure and improved mood during periods of stress (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nMilk fat is one of the most complex of all natural fats, containing about 400 different types of fatty acids (7Trusted Source).\nIn contrast to trans fats in processed foods, dairy trans fats \u2014 also called ruminant trans fats \u2014 are considered beneficial for health.\nMilk contains small amounts of trans fats, such as vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (7Trusted Source).\nCLA has attracted considerable attention due to its various possible health benefits \u2014 though evidence is still limited (8, 9Trusted Source, 10).\nMilk is an excellent source of high-quality protein and different fats.\nMilk contains all the vitamins and minerals necessary to sustain growth and development in a young calf during its first months of life.\nAs a public health strategy, fortifying milk products with vitamin D is common and even mandatory in some countries (17Trusted Source).\nIn the United States, 1 cup (240 ml) of vitamin-D-fortified milk may contain 65% of the daily recommended allowance for this nutrient (18Trusted Source).\nMore than 50 different hormones are naturally present in cow\u2019s milk, which are important for the development of the newborn calf (19).\nWith the exception of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cow milk hormones have no known effects in humans.\nOnly one of them \u2014 insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) \u2014 has potential health effects in people.\nCow\u2019s milk seems to have similar effects in people and has been associated with a higher bone density (15Trusted Source).\nThe high calcium and protein content of milk are the two main factors believed responsible for this effect (21Trusted Source).\nDairy products have been linked to a reduced risk of high blood pressure (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nBeing a rich source of calcium, milk may promote increased bone mineral density, cutting your risk of osteoporosis.\nLactose intolerance is most prominent in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America, where its estimated to affect 65\u201395% of the population (27Trusted Source).\nIn Europe, the estimated prevalence is 5\u201315%, with people in Northern Europe being the least affected (27Trusted Source).\nMost often, allergic symptoms are caused by whey proteins called alpha-lactoglobulin and beta-lactoglobulin, but they can also be due to caseins (29Trusted Source).\nHigh milk consumption is known to increase levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone thought to be involved in the appearance of acne (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHowever, a fair number of studies indicate that dairy consumption may increase the risk of prostate cancer in men (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).\nConversely, numerous studies have found a link between dairy consumption and a lower risk of colorectal cancer (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nMany people are intolerant to lactose, and some are allergic to whey or casein.\nMilk has also been linked to other adverse effects, such as an increased risk of acne and prostate cancer.\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to destroy potentially harmful bacteria that are occasionally found in raw milk (41Trusted Source).\nHomogenization does not have any adverse effects on nutritional quality (43Trusted Source).\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to increase shelf life and minimize the risk of illness from harmful microorganisms that may be present in raw milk.\nHeating results in a slight decrease in several vitamins, but this loss is not significant from a health perspective (44, 45Trusted Source, 46).\nHomogenization \u2014 the process of breaking the fat globules in milk into smaller units \u2014 has no known adverse health effects (43Trusted Source).\nDrinking raw milk is associated with a reduced risk of childhood asthma, eczema, and allergies.\nAlthough raw milk is more natural than processed milk, its consumption is riskier.\nIt\u2019s during the milking process, transport, or storage that milk gets contaminated with bacteria \u2014 either from the cow itself or the environment.\nAlthough the risk of getting ill from drinking raw milk is small, a single milk-borne infection may have serious consequences.\nMost public health advocates agree that any potential health benefits of drinking raw milk are outweighed by possible health risks resulting from contamination with harmful bacteria (48).\nDrinking raw milk is not recommended, as it may be contaminated with harmful bacteria.\nIt\u2019s not only rich in high-quality protein but also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin.\nStill, some people are allergic to milk proteins or intolerant to milk sugar (lactose).\nAt the end of the day, moderate consumption of cow\u2019s milk is healthy for most people \u2014 but you should avoid drinking it in excess.\nThis article examines the health effects of dairy products, which seem to vary greatly between individuals.\nThis article investigates if the potential benefits of raw milk outweigh\u2026 Each type of milk has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on a person's diet, health, nutritional needs, or personal taste preferences.\nDairy is the best source of calcium in the diet, the main mineral in bones."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-milk","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/milk-benefits","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/milk"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
