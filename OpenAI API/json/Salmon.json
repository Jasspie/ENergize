decline: This isn\u2019t just about fish | The Seattle Times","2":"Court Orders FDA to Assess Environmental Impact of GM Salmon | Health News | US News"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"The population of wild salmon declined markedly in recent decades, especially North Atlantic populations which spawn in the waters of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild salmon in the Snake and Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe decline is attributed to the following factors: The transfer of parasites from open-net cage salmon farming, especially sea lice, has reduced numbers of wild salmon.\nIt is reported that wild salmon on the west coast of Canada are being driven to extinction by sea lice from nearby salmon farms.[2] Dr Krkosek and his research group found, with their electronic modeling predictions, two of the best runs ever recorded for wild salmon instead of the expected collapsed salmon fishery.\nSeveral seafood sustainability guides have recommendations on which salmon fisheries are sustainable and which have negative impacts on salmon populations There are many methods of harvest for the commercial salmon fishing industry, such as trolling, seining, and gillnetting.\nGillnets are an extremely size-selective method of harvest, where a long net is placed in the path of the salmon's migration to their natal stream in hopes of entangling the salmon for commercial harvest.\nFor example, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 2010 Commercial Regulations had a 7-inch (180\u00a0mm) minimum mesh size restriction for Chinook, and a 5-inch (130\u00a0mm) minimum \u2013 5.5-inch (140\u00a0mm) maximum for sockeye.[4] Possible problems arising from this selective harvest are smaller reproducing adult fish, as well as the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery.\nA recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests.\nThe study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946 to 2005 was 8\u00a0mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.[3] If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it often sustains injuries.\nA study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11 \u2013 29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.[5] Competition between juvenile salmon entering the ocean, other wild salmon, and hatchery-released salmon in the ocean is a major factor that determines survival rates.[6] Hatchery production has increased since 1970, and there is high spatial and trophic, dietary overlap between wild and hatchery sockeye, pink and chum salmon in the North Pacific.[7] With more competition for prey and space in the ocean, the period of maturation in saltwater before salmon reach sexual spawning age grows.\nWarmer temperatures of streams during spawning and incubation have negative effects on salmon productivity due to pre-spawn mortality, reduced egg survival, and temporal changes during salmon embryo development.[8] However, the effects of higher stream temperatures during juvenile rearing vary across populations and habitats.\nFor some watersheds as temperatures increase, an increase in turbidity and reduction in invertebrate food availability is found to cause a reduction in growth rates of juvenile salmon.\nReduced retention of the nutrients brought by the returning adult salmon in stream pools has lowered population numbers.\nThe construction of dams, weirs, barriers and other \"food prevention\" measures bring severe adverse impacts to river habitat and on the accessibility of those habitats to salmon, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where large numbers of dams have been built in many river systems, including over 400 in the Columbia River Basin.[9] Other environmental factors, such as light intensity, water flow, or change in temperature, dramatically affects salmon during their migration season.[10] Modern farming methods and various sources of pollution have resulted in loss of invertebrate diversity and population density in rivers, thus reducing food availability.\nReduction in freshwater base flow in rivers and disruption of seasonal flows, because of diversions and extractions, hydroelectric power generation, irrigation schemes, barge transportation, and slackwater reservoirs, inhibit normal migratory processes and increase predation for salmon.[11] Agricultural practices, such as the removal of riparian plants, destabilization of stream banks by livestock and irrigation processes, result in a loss of suitable low-gradient stream habitats.[12][13] Climate change is affecting different types of salmon in ways from short term affects such as a decrease in population to long term affects such as evolution change.\nThe change in temperature has left salmon most vulnerable during their egg stage, and the becoming adult stage of its life cycle (9) Climate change has caused salmon to spend less time in their natural freshwater habitat (10) (1).\nThis type of stressor can affect the age class of salmon because it causes them to migrate at an early stage, which would cause them to delay maturation making them spend an additional year feeding in the ocean.\nWhen the water temperature increases the thermal requirements for the three species (Atlantic Salmon, Brown Trout, and Arctic Charr) are a necessity because if any other problems occur it can be predicted\/anticipated by those of the biodiversity in the freshwater ecosystems (2).\nThis can cause a population crash since the increased temperature will affect the eggs and may also bring in more diseases and illnesses towards the species (6).\nThese species of fish help support and provide for important fisheries in Western Europe, so, according to a scholarly journal their research finding say that salmon populations changes from environmental issues has a massive affect many other populations in distant habitats (2)(3).\nThe long term affects from climate change produce more selection pressures in different parts of salmon's life such as Juvenile growth, development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance.\nIn Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed.\nMeanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill\u2014net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.\nThe commercial salmon fisheries in California have been either severely curtailed or closed completely in recent years, due to critically low returns on the Klamath and or Sacramento Rivers, causing millions of dollars in losses to commercial fishermen.[22] Both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are popular sportfish.\nResults overall show estuary problems exist for some rivers, but issues involving feeding grounds at sea are impacting populations as well.\nThe Puget Sound Partnership has now rehabilitated over 800 acres of salmon habitat and it plans to continue to fight nearshore development and human impact affecting important salmon ecosystems.","1":"Historically, adult salmon returns to the Columbia Basin were at least 10 to 16 million fish annually \u2014 today, across the Northwest, less than 5 percent of historic populations of wild salmon and steelhead return to our rivers and streams.\nMore than 135 other fish and wildlife populations benefit from the presence of wild salmon and steelhead, from southern resident orca whales, which are at a 30-year population low, to eagles, wolves, bear, otter, coyote, seals and sea lions.\nJoseph Bogaard, executive director of the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, says the impact on orcas is immense.\nLack of chinook salmon has been strongly implicated as the main cause of decline.\u201d Other animals and plant life aren\u2019t the only ones that lose out when salmon are lost, our very landscape and culture are at stake as well, argues Langdon Cook, author of \u201cUpstream: Searching for Wild Salmon, from River to Table.\u201d \u201cSalmon are a keystone species in the Pacific Northwest\u2026 they have shaped our landscape as much as the glaciers and volcanoes.\n\u201cThe most important action we can take to help salmon and steelhead survive and thrive is to restore healthy habitat and access to healthy habitat.\u201d Montgomery, studied three different salmon habitats in his book \u201cKing of Fish\u201d: the United Kingdom, New England and the Pacific Northwest.\n\u201cI researched those various factors and how they\u2019ve affected salmon throughout history and found commonalities that were repeating in the Northwest that have already played out in Europe and New England, where their salmon decline was not only dramatic, it became permanent.\u201d Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition of more than 40 organizations including conservation organizations, recreational and commercial fishing associations and clean energy and orca advocates, is working to secure removal of the four lower Snake River dams in southeastern Washington state and to include \u201cecosystem function\u201d in the upcoming U.S.-Canada Columbia River Treaty negotiations.\n\u201cThe Snake River Basin, in central Idaho, Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington, has more than 5,500 miles of healthy, pristine, often high and cold, protected salmon habitat,\u201d says Bogaard.\nFour costly, outdated dams on the lower Snake River.\u201d Bogaard believes dam removal is one of the most important opportunities to restore salmon habitats and access to those habitats.\n\u201cSince then, salmon and steelhead populations have begun to reinhabit stretches of river that have not seen salmon in 100 years,\u201d he says.\nWhen rivers are restored and fish allowed to return, whole ecosystems can be restored.\u201d In addition to dam removal, there are other environmental changes impacting salmon that we can reverse if we act soon, says Jacques White, executive director of Long Live the Kings, a 31-year-old conservation organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the wild salmon and steelhead populations.\n\u201cYou can help restore salmon habitat in your community by practicing low-impact landscaping and gardening,\u201d says White.\nThis label recognizes farmers who adopt conservations practices that help promote healthy watersheds and protect native salmon habitat, says David J.\n\u201cThe Salmon-Safe label is a great addition to organic certification because it shows a commitment to restoring local salmon streams, an important issue to farm customers and community,\u201d Burger says.\n\u201cFarms that go through the assessment sometimes have conditions that identify areas for improvement that include; manure management, fish passage, habitat restoration (planting trees and shrubs) and improving irrigation practices.\u201d To get involved and stay up-to-date on salmon conservation legislation and news,

DHA per day (3Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA have been credited with several health benefits, such as decreasing inflammation, lowering blood pressure, reducing the risk of cancer and improving the function of the cells that line your arteries (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nA 2012 analysis of 16 controlled studies found that taking 0.45\u20134.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day led to significant improvements in arterial function (8Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, studies have shown that getting these omega-3 fats from fish increases levels in your body just as effectively as supplementing with fish oil capsules (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nAs for how much fish to eat, consuming at least two servings of salmon per week can help meet your omega-3 fatty acid needs.\nSalmon is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure and decrease risk factors for disease.\nRecent research has found that for optimal health, each meal should provide at least 20\u201330 grams of high-quality protein (16Trusted Source).\nBelow is the B vitamin content in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of wild salmon (2): These vitamins are involved in several important processes in your body, including turning the food you eat into energy, creating and repairing DNA and reducing the inflammation that can lead to heart disease (17Trusted Source).\nSalmon is an excellent source of several B vitamins, which are needed for energy production, controlling inflammation and protecting heart and brain health.\nA large analysis of 31 studies found that supplementing with potassium significantly reduced blood pressure, especially when added to a high-sodium diet (22Trusted Source).\n100 grams of salmon provide 11\u201318% of the RDI of potassium, which helps control blood pressure and prevent excess fluid retention.\nStudies have shown that selenium helps protect bone health, decreases thyroid antibodies in people with autoimmune thyroid disease and may reduce the risk of cancer (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nConsuming salmon and other high-selenium seafood has been shown to improve blood levels of selenium in people whose diets are low in this mineral (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nOne study found that blood levels of selenium increased significantly more in people who consumed two servings of salmon per week than those who consumed fish oil capsules containing less selenium (29Trusted Source).\nA 100-gram serving of salmon provides 59\u201367% of the RDI of selenium, a mineral involved in protecting bone health, improving thyroid function and reducing the risk of cancer.\nAstaxanthin appears to lower the risk of heart disease by reducing oxidation of LDL (the \u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol and increasing HDL (the \u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nOne study found that 3.6 mg of astaxanthin daily was enough to reduce oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which could potentially reduce the risk of heart disease (30Trusted Source).\nIn addition, astaxanthin is believed to work with salmon\u2019s omega-3 fatty acids to protect the brain and nervous system from inflammation (32Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that when the balance of these two fatty acids is off, the risk of heart disease increases (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nIn a four-week study of healthy men and women, consuming two servings of farmed salmon per week increased omega-3 blood levels by 8\u20139% and decreased omega-6 levels (39Trusted Source).\nAlso, consuming salmon and other fatty fish has been found to lower triglycerides and raise levels of omega-3 fats more than fish oil supplements do (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source).\nConsuming salmon can help protect against heart disease by increasing levels of omega-3 fats, decreasing levels of omega-6 fats and lowering triglycerides.\nIn addition, your metabolic rate increases more after eating protein-rich foods like salmon, compared to other foods (43Trusted Source).\nOne study in children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease found that supplementing with DHA, the main omega-3 found in salmon, led to significantly greater reductions in liver fat and belly fat, compared to a placebo (46Trusted Source).\nSeveral studies have found that eating more salmon helps reduce markers of inflammation in people at risk for these and other diseases (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source).\nIn an eight-week study of middle-aged and elderly Chinese women, consuming 3 ounces (80 grams) of salmon and other fatty fish daily led to reductions in the inflammatory markers TNF-a and IL-6 (35Trusted Source).\nIn another eight-week study, 12 men with ulcerative colitis who consumed 21 ounces (600 grams) of salmon per week experienced a decrease in inflammatory markers in their blood and colon, along with self-reported improvements in symptoms (51Trusted Source).\nSalmon and other fatty fish can help lower inflammation, which may reduce risk factors for several diseases and improve symptoms in people with inflammatory conditions.\nBoth fatty fish and fish oil have been found to reduce depressive symptoms, protect fetal brain health during pregnancy, decrease anxiety, slow age-related memory loss and lower the risk of dementia (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).\nFrequent salmon consumption may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, protect fetal brain health in pregnancy and decrease the risk of age-related memory problems.\nAdditionally, canned salmon is a quick and inexpensive option that provides the same impressive health benefits as fresh fish.\nConsuming at least two servings per week can help you meet your nutrient needs and reduce the risk of several diseases.","2":"However, salmon is a nutrient-dense fish that can be found with minimal toxins, especially if you buy it wild.\nWith salmon's heart-healthy omega-3s, high-quality protein, and rich micronutrient content, it's worth adding to your meal plan.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 3 ounces (85g) of raw, wild Atlantic salmon.1\ufeff Salmon is naturally free of carbohydrates, including fiber and sugar.\nA 3-ounce serving of raw salmon has 5.4 grams of fat.\nThe fatty acid profile of salmon varies depending on whether it is farm-raised or wild-caught.\nFarmed salmon is higher in fat content overall, including saturated fat.\nWild salmon is leaner.2\ufeff There are 17 grams of protein in a 3-ounce fillet of raw, wild-caught salmon.\nBecause farm-raised salmon has more fat, it contains slightly less protein by weight.\nRegardless, salmon is an excellent source of high-quality complete protein that provides all of the essential amino acids our bodies require.\nIt is one of the few natural food sources of vitamin D (wild salmon is a particularly good source).3\ufeff Salmon is also rich in several minerals including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium.\nFish has been long considered a health-promoting food.\nCanned wild salmon is an excellent source of both vitamin D and calcium\u2014two essential bone-building nutrients.\nWhile farmed salmon also provides some vitamin D, the amount varies based on the type of feed used.\nStudies predict that increasing the vitamin D content of farm-raised salmon would have positive effects on human bone health.3\ufeff Salmon's high protein content also contributes to bone health by supporting muscle strength.\nInsufficient omega-3 intake during pregnancy and breastfeeding has been found to hinder infant brain growth.6\ufeff Salmon is lower in mercury than larger fish, like tuna or swordfish, making it a good choice for pregnant women to regularly consume in moderation.\nAstaxanthin is a carotenoid with neuroprotective properties that appear to work in conjunction with omega-3s to slow the aging of the brain.8\ufeff Allergy to fish, including salmon, is potentially life-threatening with anaphylaxis as a common symptom.9\ufeff Fish allergies are different than allergies to other types of seafood, like shellfish.\nIf you suspect an allergy to salmon or other finned fish, see an allergist for a full evaluation and treatment plan.\nThere is some controversy about eating wild versus farmed salmon.\nBut researchers also acknowledge that the benefits of salmon consumption may outweigh potential risks.12\ufeff To reduce your risk and gain the benefits of eating salmon, look for wild-caught salmon, if possible.\nSalmon can be purchased fresh, frozen, smoked, or canned (which is typically wild-caught).\nThere are several varieties of salmon, including Atlantic, Chinook, coho, and sockeye salmon which are farmed or fished all over the world.13\ufeff Salmon can be found at any time of the year in the grocery store or seafood markets.\nWhole fish should have clear, shiny eyes, firm flesh that springs back when pressed, and should smell fresh and mild (never overly fishy or like ammonia).14\ufeff When buying frozen seafood, watch out for broken packaging or packaging with frozen ice crystals that may indicate that the package was allowed to thawed and refreeze.\nEating undercooked or raw seafood is dangerous, especially for pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.\nIf you choose to eat raw salmon in sushi or sashimi, be sure to go to a reputable restaurant and understand that there are risks of foodborne illness.\nFish, salmon, Atlantic, wild, raw.\nFish faceoff: Wild salmon
