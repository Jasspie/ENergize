CR\u00caTE, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 Cabbage, Brassica oleracea subsp.\nCabbage is cooked as a green vegetable, eaten raw, and frequently preserved as in sauerkraut or pickle.\nJaiswal, in Nutritional Composition and Antioxidant Properties of Fruits and Vegetables, 2020 Cabbage, also referred to as Brassica oleracea L.\ncapitata, is a cruciferous Brassica vegetable hailing from the Cruciferae plant family or mustard family.\nAside from cabbage, the Brassica genus is comprised of various other leafy vegetable cultivars including broccoli, Brussel sprouts, garden cress, cauliflower, collard greens, mustard, turnips, and bok choy to name a few.\nThe main varieties of cabbage cultivars include red, white, and savoy cabbages which can be prepared in a number of ways for eating, that is, stewed, shredded, steamed, pickled, fermented, boiled, saut\u00e9ed, or eaten raw.\nIt is estimated that cabbage comprises approximately 30% of the total production of ground vegetables in Poland and in Sweden the average person consumes 6.3\u00a0kg of cabbage annually with a coleslaw-like dish being a major source of cabbage intake (Wennberg et al., 2006).\nApproximately 88% of the world\u2019s cabbage consumption is while it is in its fresh form, whilst in countries such as Germany and Austria, fermented cabbage (sauerkraut) is more popular, with Canada, the United States, and Russia also being large consumers of sauerkraut (Chun et al., 2004; Kusznierewicz et al., 2008).\nLong before being used as a food source, traditionally cabbage was used for medicinal purposes for treating various types of cancer, headaches, diarrhea, gout, peptic ulcers, as well as for detoxifying the body (Higdon et al., 2007; \u0160amec et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2006).\nFrom the available scientific literature, it has been reported that the health benefits of cabbage are linked to the beneficial compounds referred to as \u201cphytochemicals\u201d contained within this vegetable.\nPhytochemicals are naturally occurring biologically active compounds in plants which are released as a means of protection in response to environmental stresses or pathogens but are also said to provide several health benefits when consumed (Martinez et al., 2017).\nCabbage is considered an excellent source of polyphenols with substantial antioxidant properties associated with the alleviation of oxidative stress and the prevention of free-radical mediated diseases.\nBlanching causes adverse losses in the antioxidant capacity of cabbage with over 70% resulting within the first few minutes.\nBlanching time, water to cabbage ratio, and cabbage variety are the main determinants of the extent of antioxidant losses.\nHigh temperatures and short blanching times would reduce antioxidants degradation in cabbage while also resulting in optimized sensory and quality attributes.\nLuud J.W.J. Gilissen, in Nutritional and Health Aspects of Food in Western Europe, 2020 Cabbage in various forms are considered cultivar groups of a single species (Brassica oleracea), originated from the wild cabbage (B.\nThe West-Friesland area, i.e., the north-west part of the Netherlands, where the major Dutch (read international) vegetable seed companies are located, was and still is extremely suitable for the cultivation of high quality vegetables, including cabbage.\nThe typical flavor of cabbage is caused by a metabolite type, called glucosinolates (sulfur containing glucosides), which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes in the body.\nCabbage (and cruciferous vegetables in general) may reduce the risk of colon cancer.\nFang, in Nuts and Seeds in Health and Disease Prevention, 2011  Glucosinolate, sulfur-containing organic anions bonded to glucose, is present in plants, including cabbages.\nOne such product, thiocyanate, exerts harmful effects on the thyroidal metabolism owing to competition with iodine.\nWhether the average daily intake of thiocyanate through Brassicaceae vegetables in Korea has any effect on health remains to be seen (Han & Kwon, 2009).\nThis can be avoided by blanching the entire or chopped cabbage for 5 minutes, replacing the water with fresh water, and then cooking the cabbage.\nToxic amounts of S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide, an alpha-amino acid that can induce hemolytic anemia in livestock, are produced by all Brassica vegetables.\noleracea) is the only vegetable in which vitamin B12 is found, which is recognized for its well-functioning nervous system.\nCabbage juice is considered as one of the most effective remedies for healing vitamin C deficiency.\nBeverages obtained from cabbage juice have a high content of vitamins, calcium, magnesium, iodine, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and copper, and have strong anticancer effects.\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of raw cabbage and sauerkraut juices of different origins (industrial or organic farming) and their major indole components (I3C\u2014indole-3-carbinol and DIM\u2014diindolylmethane) on aromatase expression in two breast cancer cell lines.\nThe results suggest that chemopreventive activity of cabbage against breast cancer may be partly explained by inhibition of the aromatase expression (Licznerska et al., 2013, 2016).\nYau-Sang Chan, in Nuts and Seeds in Health and Disease Prevention, 2011  Glucosinolate, sulfur-containing organic anions bonded to glucose, exists in plants including cabbages.\nOne such decomposed product, thiocyanate, exerts harmful effects on thyroidal metabolism, owing to competition with iodine.\nWhen this was compared to published animal studies, average thiocyanate intake per person was lower than doses required to produce adverse effects.\nYusuf Tutar, in Nutrients in Beverages, 2019 Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a cold-tolerant vegetable grown in winter that belongs to the Cruciferae family.\nBecause of its rich phytochemical content, cabbage juice may show antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticarcinogenic effects.\nThe antioxidant activity of cabbage is related with the high vitamin C content (Dumbrav\u0103 et al., 2011).\nThe antiinflammatory effects of the acetone extract of cabbage were investigated.\nThe rats were divided into five groups and given SSJ at three different doses for 28\u00a0days and the effects of high-fat diet on obesogenic properties were determined.\nIn another study, rats were fed cabbage juice in order to compare its effect on peptic ulcer with medical treatment.\nAfter 30\u00a0days, cabbage juice exerted shorter bleeding and clotting times when compared with drugs and this effect was related to vitamin K content (Oguwike et al., 2014).\nIf these rings form, the eggs were probably cooked too long and at temperatures that were too high.\nTo help prevent sulfur rings, eggs should be placed into cold water and then quickly brought to a boil over high heat.\nCabbage and its relatives in the cruciferous family (broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts) do not lose all of their sulfur compounds after cutting or cooking.\nAdditionally, more sulfur-containing molecules may be formed when cruciferous vegetables are cooked."},"environment_urls":{"0":"ensia.com\/articles\/phytomining-lithium-batteries-ev\/","1":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1161030120301775","2":"www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/medicine-and-dentistry\/cabbage"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

in the body, including energy metabolism and the normal functioning of the nervous system.\nIn addition, cabbage is high in fiber and contains powerful antioxidants, including polyphenols and sulfur compounds (2).\nCabbage is especially high in vitamin C, a potent antioxidant that may protect against heart disease, certain cancers and vision loss (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, chronic inflammation that occurs over a long period of time is associated with many diseases, including heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (6Trusted Source).\nCruciferous vegetables like cabbage contain many different antioxidants that have been shown to reduce chronic inflammation (7).\nIn fact, research has shown that eating more cruciferous vegetables reduces certain blood markers of inflammation (8Trusted Source).\nSulforaphane, kaempferol and other antioxidants found in this remarkable group of plants are likely responsible for their anti-inflammatory effect (10, 11Trusted Source).\nVitamin C works to protect the body from damage caused by free radicals, which has been associated with many chronic diseases, including cancer (14Trusted Source).\nEvidence suggests that a diet high in vitamin-C-rich foods is associated with a lower risk of certain cancers (13, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nIn fact, a recent analysis of 21 studies found that the risk of lung cancer decreased by 7% for each daily 100-mg increase in vitamin C intake (17Trusted Source).\nHowever, this study was limited because it could not determine whether the decreased risk of lung cancer was caused by vitamin C or other compounds found in fruits and vegetables.\nWhile many observational studies have found a link between higher vitamin C intake and a reduced risk of certain cancers, results from controlled studies remain inconsistent (18Trusted Source, 19, 20Trusted Source).\nEven though more research is needed to determine this vitamin\u2019s role in cancer prevention, it\u2019s certain that vitamin C plays a key role in many important functions in the body.\nInsoluble fiber helps keep the digestive system healthy by adding bulk to stools and promoting regular bowel movements (22Trusted Source).\nMany studies have found a link between eating foods rich in this pigment and a reduced risk of heart disease (26Trusted Source).\nIn a study including 93,600 women, researchers found that those with a higher intake of anthocyanin-rich foods had a much lower risk of a heart attack (27Trusted Source).\nIt found that increasing flavonoid intake by 10 mg per day was associated with a 5% lower risk of heart disease (28).\nIncreasing your intake of dietary anthocyanins has also been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of coronary artery disease (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nInflammation is known to play a major role in the development of heart disease, and anthocyanins\u2019 protective effect against it is likely due to their anti-inflammatory qualities.\nCabbage contains more than 36 different kinds of potent anthocyanins, making it an excellent choice for heart health (31).\nHigh blood pressure affects more than one billion people worldwide and is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke (32Trusted Source).\nHowever, recent evidence suggests that increasing your dietary potassium is just as important for lowering blood pressure (33).\nEating more potassium-rich cabbage is a delicious way to lower high blood pressure and may help keep it within a healthy range (33).\nCritical processes depend on cholesterol, such as proper digestion and the synthesis of hormones and vitamin D (36Trusted Source).\nHowever, people who have high cholesterol also tend to have an increased risk of heart disease, especially when they have elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol (37Trusted Source).\nCabbage contains two substances that have been shown to decrease unhealthy levels of LDL cholesterol.\nSoluble fiber has been shown to help lower \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol levels by binding with cholesterol in the gut and keeping it from being absorbed into the blood.\nA large analysis of 67 studies showed that when people ate 2\u201310 grams of soluble fiber per day, they experienced a small, yet significant, decrease in LDL cholesterol levels of roughly 2.2 mg per deciliter (38Trusted Source).\nIncreasing phytosterol intake by 1 gram per day has been found to reduce LDL cholesterol concentrations by as much as 5% (40Trusted Source).\nVitamin K1 is a key nutrient that plays many important roles in the body.\nNo matter how you prepare cabbage, adding this cruciferous vegetable to your plate is a tasty way to benefit your health.\nIn addition, eating cabbage may even help lower the risk of certain diseases, improve digestion and combat inflammation.","1":"\"You want to avoid long cooking methods and boiling,\" Smith says, explaining that those ways can rob the food of its nutrients.\nVitamin C helps your body absorb iron from the plant-based foods you eat, makes collagen to help wounds heal, and bolsters your immune system to help protect you from disease,\u00a0according to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS).\n(FYI: The recommended daily intake is 25 grams for women aged 19 to 50,\u00a0per MedlinePlus.) \"Cabbage is a good source of fiber [and] fiber may help alleviate constipation, balance blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol levels and improve digestive health,\" Gans says.\nCabbage contains a nutrient hugely important to both bone health and healthy blood clotting functions in the body: vitamin K, Gans says.\nOne cup of cooked cabbage is only 34 calories, making it an excellent option for weight management,\" Gans says.\nYou might not immediately think of cabbage as a heart-healthy food, but you may want to add it to your diet if you're trying to be more conscious of the health of your ticker.\n\"Cabbage is a cruciferous vegetable and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory benefits, therefore recommended for those individuals who are at risk for heart disease,\" Gans says.\nThe study concluded that eating more cruciferous veggies can protect against that buildup of calcium and ultimately benefit heart health.\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, contain compounds called glucosinolates, which are sulfur-containing chemicals (they're responsible for the bitter taste lots of cruciferous veggies have).\nDuring food prep, chewing, and digestion, those glucosinolates are then broken down into certain compounds that have been examined for their anti-cancer benefits.\nExperts say much more research needs to be done on the cancer-fighting benefits of cruciferous veggies.","2":"This isn\u2019t true for cabbage, which many people think of as one of the world's most nutritious foods.\nLow in calories and chock full of important vitamins and minerals, cabbage is also versatile enough to be used in a variety of tasty meals, including a wide array of regional specialties.\nAdditionally, cabbage contains a variety of antioxidant compounds that fight free radicals and reduce stress on your cells.\nMultiple studies suggest that applying cabbage leaves to your breasts may reduce both pain and breast hardness.\nA diet high in leafy green vegetables like cabbage may reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nCabbage and related vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts contain high levels of a chemical known as indole-3-carbinol.\nScientists believe this chemical may play an important role in preventing several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.\nEating just one serving of leafy green vegetables per day can promote brain health and reduce your risk of developing dementia.\nLike many vegetables from the Cruciferae family, cabbage can cause gas and bloating.\nDamaged leaves can be peeled away to reveal a healthy cabbage.\nBMJ: \"Fruit and Vegetable Intake and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\" F1000 Research: \"Indole-3-Carbinol: A
