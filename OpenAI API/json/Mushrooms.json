and Environmental Impact of Mushrooms | Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Environmental Science","2":"American Mushroom Institute - Sustainability"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"The industry of composting urban waste for disposal differs from our mushroom composting goals.\nWhereas our high temperature (160-180 \u00b0F) or thermogenic composting process prevents such degradation, and conserves carbon so that the 50% reduction of organic matter occurs during the cropping process.\nThese differences must be emphasized for any reference or comparison with composting waste materials for disposal.\nIt is important that mushroom researchers understand the problems of urban waste composting.\nA future possibility is to build a mushroom farm to use previously composted urban waste.\nWhen the mushroom takes up where the thermophilic organisms stop in recycling the carbon of green plants it uses part of the compost as nutrient in producing its fruiting bodies.\nMost of the compost is left behind as a residue called spent compost, spent mushroom substrate or more recently proposed \"post mushroom substrate.\" This material is ready to be further attacked by a new set of organisms.\nFortunately, post mushroom substrate is not spent and has many uses.\nIt is not simply a matter of making it available, but growers must think of the removal of this substrate as a marketing opportunity: adapting the material to that of the gardeners' needs, further decomposing of the substrate or mixing other ingredients into it to enhance or dilute nutrients.\nIn the areas where many mushroom farms are concentrated near an urban area, the disposal of spent compost is still a problem for most growers.\nAn urgent situation is approaching in some areas and disposal of the post mushroom substrate is essential for the mushroom farmers' survival.\nStudies at the Stroud Water Research Center suggest that the impact to the ground water under post mushroom substrate pile is minimal.\nThe mushroom industry must try to educate not only the community but all possible users about the value of post mushroom substrate.\nLocal garden centers should be telling their customers to use post mushroom substrate as a mulch around newly planted shrubs and add it to their garden soil.\nThe floriculture research done at Vineland, Ontario and other places should be widely distributed as educational material to promote the use of post mushroom substrate in container crops.\nResearch at Penn State and around the world continues to show the value of post mushroom substrate as source of nutrients for many crops and plants.\nSpent compost is a source of nutrients and water holding properties for such crops such as corn and other vegetables.\nThe corn plant is unable to use all the nitrates because of another limiting factor, possibly the organic carbon compounds that hold water.\nIt is possible that spent compost would be an ideal source of organic carbon material to retain the nitrate rich water in the soils.\nPost mushroom substrate, possibly mixed with the fresh animal manure, would allow corn farmers to add the quantity of manure required, without the fear of excess nitrates or nutrients leaching into the ground.\nOther environmental, agricultural and industrial uses of post mushroom substrate were summarized in the proceeding from the SMS Symposium of 1994.\nCompost teas from post mushroom substrate have been somewhat effective in controlling apple scab and late blight of tomatoes.\nHowever, producing a second crop of mushrooms by supplementing spent mushroom substrate with certain additives may be possible.\nBy controlling the ionic activity of calcium and potassium in the compost solution, phosphorus availability is increased and later break yields can be improved.\nHowever development of the mechanism involved in increasing phosphorus nutrition, availability or uptake may increase the amount of substrate consumed by the mushroom and reduce the quantity of post mushroom substrate remaining after harvesting 3-4 breaks.\nOffensive odors from improperly managed drainage catch basins and from the practice of pumping anaerobic water back onto the raw ingredients is often the source of neighbor complaints.\nWater that drains from composting yards and mushroom houses that may pollute the local water supplies has been reduced or most often eliminated.\nEventually all composting operations may have to use plans similar to those suggested by the Soil and Water Conservation Agencies.\nThese agencies have helped several farms in the installation of water runoff containment sites for their composting wharves or spent substrate storage areas.\nIt solves the disposal problem and adds a useful supplement to the compost nutrition.\nIt may be possible that municipal waste composting operations could use mushroom stems as a source of moisture and\/or carbohydrates.\nBesides parasitic wasps, other biological control products are available for the growers to use.\nIn the days of the horse and buggy, the mushroom industry provided a valuable way to dispose of a waste commodity.\nUnfortunately, the mushroom business grew faster than the horse racing business, so their waste is now inadequate for our industries' needs and horse manure has become a costly ingredient.\nAnother waste product mushroom farms help to dispose of is poultry manure.\nIt would be more advantageous for both industries if mushroom growers could use more poultry manure in their formulas.\nUnfortunately the mushroom industry uses relatively small amounts of poultry manure.\nTo maintain compost structure for aeration during composting requires a base of organic fibrous material to keep the piles loose and provide carbohydrates for the nutrition of the mushroom.\nPromoting mushroom farming as environmentally friendly should be a long term educational goal of the industry.\nResearchers should be more interested in testing and using agricultural and industrial waste products for mushroom compost.\nGrowers must use the mushroom's ability to consume organic materials discarded by man, to help control pollution in modern society.\nA worst case scenario is the expansion of municipal waste composting facilities to use more organic waste products for the sole purpose of disposing of urban and industry waste.\nThese waste disposal facilities will be designed for a fast, complete and efficient reduction of organic materials.\nMushroom farms will not compete well with these industries for the organic materials required by our crop.","1":"Could Not Retrieve Summary.","2":"Because of this recycling of other agricultural crops and byproducts, mushroom farms have a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other farms.\nIn fact, when you go into the store and see white or brown \u201cbutton\u201d mushrooms, you are looking at an incredibly efficient food: Today\u2019s growers use smart management and production practices that use less than 2 gallons of water to produce one pound of button mushrooms \u2013 that\u2019s about 32 (8 oz) glasses of water to grow, harvest, and process an entire pound of mushrooms, compared with an average of 50 gallons of water per pound of other fresh produce items.\nProducing one pound of button mushrooms takes 1.0 kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity.\nBecause of the way mushrooms are grown, being smart about energy use is good for production AND good for the environment.\nThis means if you added up all the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas) from producing that one pound of button mushrooms \u2013 from the compost recipe all the way through to what you purchase in the store \u2013 it is the equivalent of just 0.7 pounds of CO2.\nIn fact, one acre of land can produce 1 million pounds of mushrooms.\nBy any measure of water and energy inputs, and the low CO2 emissions, mushrooms are a nutritious food that have a very small environmental footprint.\nMore than being the \u2018ultimate recyclers,\u2019 mushroom growers are providing a sustainable, smart food source for a growing world population.\nAs consumers look to make food decisions that take environmental impacts and carbon footprint into account, mushrooms are a choice that everyone can feel good about.\nNot only are mushrooms delicious and nutritious, they are also a sustainable food consumers can feel good about purchasing.\nMushrooms have 0.5 Kilograms (kg) of CO2 per pound of food consumed."},"environment_urls":{"0":"extension.psu.edu\/impact-of-the-mushroom-industry-on-the-environment","1":"oxfordre.com\/environmentalscience\/view\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780199389414.001.0001\/acrefore-9780199389414-e-231","2":"www.americanmushroom.org\/main\/sustainability\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

of traditional medicineTrusted Source.\nIn this article, learn about the nutritional contents and possible health benefits of eating mushrooms.\nThe antioxidant content in mushrooms may help prevent lung, prostate, breast, and other types of cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nSome sources have suggested that selenium may help prevent cancer, but a Cochrane review, from 2017, found no evidence to confirm this.\nThere is some evidenceTrusted Source that vitamin D supplementation may help prevent or treat some kinds of cancer, though according to a 2018 report, the effect may vary from person to person.\nSome studiesTrusted Source have suggested that consuming choline can reduce the risk of some types of cancer, but at least one other studyTrusted Source has indicated that it may increase the risk of prostate cancer.\nDietary fiber may help manage a number of health conditions, including type 2 diabetes.\nA 2018 reviewTrusted Source of meta-analyses concluded that people who eat a lot of fiber may have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nA cup of sliced, raw mushrooms, weighing 70 gramsTrusted Source (g), provides almost 1 g of fiber.\nThe Dietary
