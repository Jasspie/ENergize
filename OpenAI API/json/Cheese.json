But there\u2019s no doubt that cheese of any type\u2014pasteurized or not; made from the milk of cows or goats or sheep\u2014has a significant impact on the environment compared with other food products.\nBased on figures from Sweden, the production of a 1.5-ounce serving of cheese might be expected to produce around 16 ounces of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, raising a milk-bearing animal puts out a significant amount of greenhouse gases, thanks in large part to the methane those ruminants emit.\nThe good news is that the American dairy industry hopes to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent in the next 10 years, through strategies like adjusting cows\u2019 diets and installing methane digesters to turn manure into electricity.\nGenerally speaking, sheep cheese is going to be worse for the planet than cow or goat varieties.\nResearchers from MTT Agrifood Research Finland, writing for the newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat in 2008, estimated that greenhouse gas emissions per unit of cheese would be roughly the same for cows and goats.\n(Cattle emit much more methane but make up for it with their increased milk yields.) A sheep, however, might emit twice the amount of methane as a cow or a goat, per unit of milk produced.\nAn exact comparison would require more information about the husbandry practices being used in each case, though\u2014and studies from New Zealand indicate that some sheep are less gassy than others.\nAll things being equal, younger cheeses are more energy-efficient than older ones, because of the electricity required to keep cheeses at a cool, steady temperature as they age.\nIn Europe, they make greater use of cool underground caves.) Likewise, soft cheeses will tend to be greener than hard ones, since the latter usually require more milk, more extensive aging processes, and longer cooking at higher temperatures.\nA recent study noted that Americans toss out a shocking 40 percent of the food we produce\u2014a figure worth keeping in mind during this festive season of gluttony.","2":"LCA results were determined by milk production impact (cow feeding).\nResults indicated that the environmental impacts derived from cheese making were mainly originated from raw milk production and the natural land transformation was the most affected of the considered categories.\nAdditionally, an average carbon footprint of the cheeses produced in the analysed facility has also been calculated, resulting milk production and pellet boiler emissions the most contributing subsystems.\nAccording to the analysed data, it is clear that the content of fat and dry extract are determinant factors for the carbon footprint of cheeses, whereas the cheesemaking scale and the geographical area have a very low effect."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.audubon.org\/news\/cheese-bad-environment","1":"slate.com\/technology\/2009\/12\/what-s-the-environmental-impact-of-cheese.html","2":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969718312026"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 90","1":" 80","2":" 10"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"Cheese: Is It Good for You?

The high levels of calcium present in dairy products like cheese can help reduce blood pressure.\nLower-fat, low-sodium cheeses, eaten in moderation as part of a healthy diet, can help lower blood pressure.\nResearch shows cheese could be a good source of glutathione, an antioxidant that helps maintain brain health.\nFermented foods like cheese and yogurt contain probiotic bacteria.\nFinally, while the saturated fats in cheese can be beneficial in small amounts, diets high in saturated fats and sodium have been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure.\nSince cheese has higher amounts of saturated fat and sodium, it\u2019s best to eat it in moderation.\nIf you're lactose intolerant, cheese made from almonds or cashews make a nice alternative, though you may need to be wary of things like added salt if you eat those.","1":"Cheese proven health benefits includes supporting healthy bones, a great source of fats, supporting healthy heart, a great source of protein, may help prevent cancer, a great source of carbohydrates, management and prevention of osteoporosis, supporting health teeth and reducing stress.\nCheese comes from dairy fermentation and certainly possess many benefits that dairy provides to the human body.\nWater 37% Cheese is rich in calcium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and protein.\nCertain varieties are also rich in vitamins and good bacteria.\nWe will further elaborate how cheese consumption can benefit the human body in 13 ways Protein is necessary for the body to maintain many functions, from a healthy metabolism to muscle regeneration.\nThe protein present in cheese is easily digestible and is especially useful in the metabolic process.\nProtein is also an excellent source of energy and is one of the most crucial requirements of the human body.\nCheese is an excellent source of protein and one way to utilize that is by adding it to your post-workout snack or on top of a salad.\nThe human body runs on Carbohydrates and requires them for the generation of energy.\nWhere most assumptions about fat being bad for the body may be true;
