Then the beans are blanched for a few minutes before being sealed in cans and then cooked and sterilized in a retort\u2014a machine that\u2019s essentially a big, steam-powered pressure cooker.\n(That\u2019s about as much energy as it takes to drive a car one-quarter of a mile.) Since kidneys and pintos are tougher and take longer to cook\u2014about 75 percent longer than green beans, according to Truitt Brothers, the cannerythat commissioned the study\u2014processing them would require more energy.\nThen there\u2019s the excellent point you raised in your question: Getting those canned beans from the production facility to your local Piggly Wiggly is indeed going to require more fuel.\nBeans, when cooked, get 150 percent heavier\u00a0because of\u00a0water absorption.\nIn the green-bean study, for example, getting the cans to the customer accounted for only 8 percent of their overall greenhouse gas emissions.\nBased on some recorded energy figures provided by food researchers at the University of Bristol, cooking five ounces of beans for that long might require 1,400 to 5,600 BTUs on a gas stovetop or 4,100 to 16,500 BTUs on an electric stovetop, though everything from the amount of water to the kind of pot used could alter those numbers.\nThe numbers above assume that the electricity is coming from a coal-fired plant, but as the Lantern has often noted in the past, the fuel mix in your area may be cleaner.) On the high end, that\u2019s a lot more energy than the industrial cookers use\u2014even if we assumed that canning dry beans was twice as energy-intensive as canning green beans, cooking those beans on the stove would take up to 11 times as much energy as at a commercial facility."},"environment_urls":{"0":"tabitha-whiting.medium.com\/should-you-buy-dried-or-tinned-beans-to-reduce-your-environmental-impact-319e7d8d3035","1":"theconversation.com\/green-beans-why-pulses-are-the-eco-friendly-option-for-feeding-and-saving-the-world-64014","2":"slate.com\/technology\/2009\/06\/the-greenest-way-to-buy-your-beans.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

article, learn about nine health benefits of beans, including getting more protein and reducing the risk of heart disease.\nBeans contain amino acids, which are the protein building blocks that the body uses to heal and to make new tissues, such as bone, muscle, hair, skin, and blood.\nThere are also two types of protein sources: complete and incomplete.\nAnimal products, soy, and quinoa are all complete proteins, which means they contain all nine essential amino acids.\nPeople can combine incomplete proteins with nuts, seeds, dairy products, or grains at a single meal or throughout the day to make complete proteins.\nThey are also lower in calories and saturated fat than some other protein sources, such as meat and full fat or low fat dairy products.\nA 1-cup, or 40 gramsTrusted Source (g), serving of canned black beans provides 14.5 g of protein, 16.6 g of fiber, and 4.56 milligrams (mg) of iron.\nA 1-cup, or 155 gTrusted Source, serving of shelled edamame beans provides 18.5 g protein, 8.06 g fiber, and 3.52 mg iron.\nFolate is essential for overall health, to make healthy red blood cells, and help prevent neural tube defects in a fetus during pregnancy.\nA 1-cup, or 155gTrusted Source, serving of shelled edamame beans provides 482 micrograms (mcg) of folate.\nAccording to researchTrusted Source, beans are rich in polyphenols, which are a type of antioxidant.\nAntioxidants fight the effectsTrusted Source of free radicals, which are damaging chemicals that the body produces during metabolism and other processes.\nAntioxidants help the body remove free radicals.\nIn this way, antioxidant-rich foods, such as beans, can help protect the body from disease.\nThe authors of a 2017 meta-analysisTrusted Source suggested that one reason for the decrease in cardiovascular risk was that people had replaced higher fat animal meat proteins with beans.\nA 2013 review and meta-analysis found a clear correlation between eating beans and a lower risk of coronary heart disease.\nThere is evidenceTrusted Source that a high fiber diet may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nHere, get some tips on foods that can help lower blood pressure.\nLearn more here about foods that provide antioxidants.\nBeans may help stabilizeTrusted Source blood glucose levels or even prevent diabetes.\nBeans are high in fiber, which can help lower blood glucose.\nThe author of a 2018 reviewTrusted Source concluded that consuming a high fiber diet could reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.\nThere was also evidence that it may help lower blood sugar in people who already have the condition.\nAnother studyTrusted Source looked specifically at the effect of adding a cup of legumes to the daily diet of people with type 2 diabetes.\nReplacing higher fat animal proteins with beans is a good step towards better liver health.\nWhen a person eats beans, the fiber and healthful starches they contain can help create a feeling of fullness and satisfaction.\nResearchTrusted Source has shown a variety of beans, especially black beans, enhance gut health by improving intestinal barrier function and increasing the number of beneficial bacteria.\nBeans provide protein, fiber, iron, and antioxidants that can make them a healthful addition to the diet.\nPeople should increase their intake of beans gradually to reduce the risk of intestinal discomfort.\nMaking a grocery list can help people plan and budget, buy nutritious foods, and improve their overall health.\nLearn about the benefits and risks of eating organ\u2026 Keep up

similar health benefits.\nThe nutrients in beans can provide significant health benefits.\nThe antioxidants found in beans can help reduce cell damage caused by free radicals.\nPeople with diabetes, especially Type 2 diabetes, often find that low-glycemic-index foods like beans help them manage their blood sugar and insulin levels more effectively.\nLower cholesterol levels help prevent problems like heart disease and stroke.\nBeans are also full of insoluble fiber, which your body can\u2019t digest.\nInsoluble fiber can help add bulk to your stools, reducing problems like constipation.\nBeans are a good source of phytonutrients.\nFor example, a half-cup serving of pinto beans contains: Beans are a significant source of plant-based protein, which makes them a staple food for people who choose to eat a plant-based diet.\nSince beans are a staple food around the world, there are hundreds of ways they can be prepared.\nTo prepare dried beans, it\u2019s important to soak them.\nYou can combine one pound of dried beans of any type with ten cups of water and leave them in the fridge to soak overnight.\nGrains and Legumes Nutrition Council: \u201cLegumes and
