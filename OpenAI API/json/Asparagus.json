big carbon footprints\u00a0that might surprise you.\nA recent study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of Industrial Ecology\u00a0looks at the climate impact of various fruits, vegetables, and animal products in the American diet.\nThe scientists assess total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production using a unit that\u2019s a little tricky to parse:\u00a0kilograms of CO2-equivalent per kilogram of food.\nAt 8.87, it produces six times the amount of\u00a0GHG\u00a0than\u00a0the next-highest vegetable.\n\u201cAir freighting is a lot more carbon-intensive than shipping or road transport,\u201d says Alexander Kasterine, head of the Trade and Environment Programme at the International Trade Centre (a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization).\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,\u00a0air-freighting takes 50 times the energy of shipping by sea, 33 times that of rail transport, and four times that of truck transport.\nClimate-wise, transport by air is unequivocally worse than other kinds.\nIf you drive a long way to the market in a gas-guzzling vehicle to buy local asparagus, your climate impact could be larger than that of the flown-in variety.\nThose states have a comparative advantage in terms of their climate and their soils.\u201d Those efficiencies, he says, \u201cmore than make up for the transport emissions,\u201d which are only about 10 percent of total climate impact as long as shipping isn\u2019t done by air.\nIt\u2019s possible that your air-freighted produce is making a huge difference to a farmer in Asia, Africa, or South America.\nThen there\u2019s the problem of trying to figure out whether any particular produce is air-freighted.\nIf it\u2019s a delicate fruit or vegetable, and it comes from a long way off (produce is required to be labeled with country of origin), it\u2019s a good bet that it\u2019s been on a plane.\nAs Kasterine says, \u201cIt\u2019s not evident what the right choices are.\u201d He has a suggestion: \u201cRelying on altruism doesn\u2019t work to de-carbonize the economy.\nTax the energy used to produce the food.\u201d\u00a0 And not just in the supply chain, he adds, but in your house, when you cook, and in your vehicle, when you drive to the market.","1":"In fact, this area has become one of the main producers of green asparagus worldwide due to the availability of water and the high yield rates that can be reached.\nHowever, irrigation and intensive agriculture constitute a significant threat to water depletion in the region, as well as to important changes in land use.\nThe aim of the study was to understand the potential environmental impacts associated with the cultivation of this product in a hyper-arid area.\nEnvironmental impacts were strongly influenced by the high energy intensity linked to the production of inorganic fertilizers used on-site and, to a lesser extent, plant protection agents.\nFinally, the use of methyl bromide to fumigate green asparagus at US customs implied a high burden in terms of ozone depletion.","2":"Asparagus weeds are aggressive vine-like plants that are
