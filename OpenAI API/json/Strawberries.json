applied the product environmental footprint (PEF) methodology to broadly indicate the environmental impacts of various strawberry production systems in Germany and Estonia by 15 impact categories.\nData for the 7 case studies were gathered from two farms with organic and two farms with conventional open field production systems in Estonia and from one farm with conventional open field and one farm with a polytunnel and greenhouse production system in Germany.\nThe greenhouse production system had the highest environmental impact with a PEF of 0.0040.\nThe main contributors were electricity for cooling, heating the greenhouse and the use of agricultural machinery including fuel burning.\nWhile production stage contributed 85% of the total impact in the greenhouse, also other life cycle stages were important contributors: pre-chain resulted in 71% and 90% of impact in conventional and polytunnels, respectively, and cooling was 47% in one organic system.\nGreenhouse heating is the overall impact hotspot even if it based on renewable resources."},"environment_urls":{"0":"prezi.com\/ph0lbuuc0stl\/environmental-impact-of-strawberries\/","1":"www.climatehubs.usda.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/Climate, Weather and

tiny strawberry is packed with vitamin C, fiber, antioxidants, and more.\nThe heart-shaped silhouette of the strawberry is the first clue that this fruit is good for you.\nPacked with vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of antioxidants known as polyphenols, strawberries are a sodium-free, fat-free, cholesterol-free, low-calorie food.\nJust one serving -- about eight strawberries -- provides more vitamin C than an orange.\nFirst cultivated in ancient Rome, strawberries are now the most popular berry fruit in the world.\nThese red gems may be good for your heart in more ways than one.\nPer serving: 251 calories, 23 g protein, 12.5 g carbohydrate, 12.8 g fat (4 g saturated fat), 177 mg cholesterol, 2.5 g fiber, 306 mg sodium.","1":"Strawberries, like most berries, are a low-glycemic fruit, making them a tasty option for people looking to control or reduce their glucose levels.\nThe vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in strawberries can provide important health benefits.\nFor example, strawberries are rich in vitamin C and polyphenols, which are antioxidant compounds that may help to prevent the development of some diseases.\nStrawberries have anti-inflammatory effects that may prevent skin damage when applied topically.\nOne small study showed the anti-inflammatory benefits of strawberries can also protect other parts of the body, including the joints.\nFor people with osteoarthritis and knee pain, strawberries can help reduce pain and swelling and improve quality of life.\nStrawberries contain a wide range of bioactive compounds that have shown protective effects against chronic diseases.\nSome research suggests that incorporating strawberries, as well as other berries, into your diet can help prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's and other disorders.\nStrawberries are rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants, which help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.","2":"Strawberries are very rich in antioxidants and plant compounds, which may have benefits for heart health and blood sugar control (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).\nThe nutrients in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw strawberries (3Trusted Source) are: Fresh strawberries are very high in water, so their total carb content is very low \u2014 fewer than 8 grams of carbs per 3.5 ounces (100 grams).\nThis means that strawberries should not lead to big spikes in blood sugar levels and are considered safe for people with diabetes.\nThey have a relatively low GI and should not cause big spikes in blood sugar levels.\nAnthocyanin content is usually proportional to color intensity, increasing greatly as the fruit ripens (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nAnthocyanin-rich foods are associated with numerous health benefits, especially regarding heart health (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nEllagitannins and ellagic acid comprise a large part of these antioxidants in strawberries (28Trusted Source).\nStrawberries contain high amounts of beneficial plant compounds and antioxidants, such as pelargonidin, ellagic acid, ellagitannins, and procyanidins.\nEating strawberries is associated with a reduced risk of many chronic diseases (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nStrawberries may improve heart health, lower blood sugar levels, and help prevent cancer.\nLarge observational studies in thousands of people link berry consumption to a lower risk of heart-related deaths (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nAccording to a study in middle-aged people with well-established risk factors for heart disease, berries may improve HDL (good) cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood platelets function (40Trusted Source).\nImbalances in blood sugar regulation and high-sugar diets are associated with an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease (50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source).\nA number of studies suggest that berries may help prevent several types of cancer through their ability to fight oxidative stress and inflammation (59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).\nThe protective effects of strawberries may be driven by ellagic acid and ellagitannins, which have been shown to stop the growth of cancer cells (64Trusted Source, 65Trusted Source).\nStrawberries may decrease your risk of heart disease and cancer, as well as help regulate blood sugar.\nStrawberries contain a protein that can cause symptoms in people who are sensitive to birch pollen or apples \u2014 a condition known as pollen-food allergy (66Trusted Source, 67Trusted Source, 68Trusted Source).\nCommon symptoms include itching or tingling in the mouth, hives, headaches, and swelling of the lips, face, tongue, or throat, as well as breathing problems in severe cases (69Trusted Source).\nThey are a good source of many vitamins, minerals and plant compounds \u2014 some of which have powerful health benefits.\nThe health benefits include reduced cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\nFurthermore, these berries may help prevent big spikes in both blood sugar and insulin levels.\nFruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants.\nBerries taste great and may have many health benefits, including preventing and reducing symptoms of chronic disease.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/features\/nutritional-benefits-of-the-strawberry","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-strawberry","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/strawberries"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
