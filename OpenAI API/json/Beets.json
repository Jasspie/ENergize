vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nBuying seasonally reduces carbon emissions from hothouses (greenhouses).\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nBeets are a root vegetable and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair

pigments, both of which are plant compounds that have a number of health benefits.\nThey also contain inorganic nitrates and pigments, both of which have a number of health benefits.\nStudies have shown that beets can significantly lower blood pressure by up to 4\u201310 mmHg over a period of only a few hours (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThese blood pressure-lowering effects are likely due to the high concentration of nitrates in beets.\nBeets contain a high concentration of nitrates, which have a blood pressure-lowering effect.\nNitrates appear to affect physical performance by improving the efficiency of mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy in your cells (11Trusted Source).\nIn two studies including seven and eight men, consuming 17 ounces (500 ml) of beet juice daily for six days extended time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise by 15\u201325%, which is a 1\u20132% improvement in overall performance (7Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nOne small study of nine competitive cyclists looked at the effect of 17 ounces (500 ml) of beetroot juice on cycling time trial performance over 2.5 and 10 miles (4 and 16.1 km).\nDrinking beetroot juice improved performance by 2.8% over the 2.5-mile (4-km) time trial and 2.7% over the 10-mile (16.1-km) trial (17Trusted Source).\nTherefore, to maximize their potential, it\u2019s best to consume beets 2\u20133 hours before training or competing (18Trusted Source).\nEating beets may enhance athletic performance by improving oxygen use and time to exhaustion.\nBeets contain pigments called betalains, which may potentially possess a number of anti-inflammatory properties (8Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nOne study in humans with osteoarthritis showed that betalain capsules made with beetroot extract reduced pain and discomfort associated with the condition (23).\nWhile these studies suggest that beets have an anti-inflammatory effect, human studies are needed to determine whether beets could be used to reduce inflammation.\nMoreover, fiber has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases including colon cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nBeets are a good source of fiber, which is beneficial for digestive health, as well as reducing the risk of a number of chronic health conditions.\nInterestingly, the nitrates in beets may improve mental and cognitive function by promoting the dilation of blood vessels and thus increasing blood flow to the brain (32Trusted Source).\nBeets have been shown to particularly improve blood flow to the frontal lobe of the brain, an area associated with higher-level thinking, such as decision making and working memory (33Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, one study in type 2 diabetics looked at the effect of beets on simple reaction time, which is a measure of cognitive function.\nSimple reaction time during a computer-based cognitive function test was 4% faster in those who consumed 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of beetroot juice daily for two weeks, compared to the placebo (34Trusted Source).\nBeets contain nitrates, which may help increase blood flow to the brain, improve cognitive function and possibly reduce the risk of dementia.\nOne test-tube study using human cells found that beetroot extract, which is high in betalain pigments, reduced the growth of prostate and breast cancer cells (37Trusted Source).\nIt is important to note that these studies were performed in isolated human cells and rats.\nStudies in isolated human cells and rats have shown that the pigments in beets may help reduce the growth of cancer cells.\nIncreasing your intake of low-calorie foods like fruits and vegetables has been associated with weight loss (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, despite their low calorie content, beets contain moderate amounts of protein and fiber.\nThe fiber in beets may also help promote weight loss by reducing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness, thereby reducing overall calorie intake (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).\nBeets have a high water and low calorie content.\nNot to mention, they are low in calories and a great source of nutrients, including fiber, folate and vitamin C.\nBeets also contain nitrates and pigments that may help lower blood pressure and improve athletic performance.","1":"Beets contain high levels of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents that studies show may help reduce the risk of some cancers.\nAlso, high levels of a unique fiber found in beets may be linked to a lower colon cancer risk.\nBeets produce nitric acid, which helps increase blood flow throughout your body, including to your brain.\nMRIs done on older adults showed that after eating a high-nitrate diet that included beet juice, the subjects had more blood flow to the white matter of their frontal lobes.\nFiber helps keep your digestive system running smoothly, and one of the many health benefits of beets is that they are chock full of it.\nDespite all these health benefits of beets,\u00a0there are also some risks.\nNow that you know all of the beets health benefits, check out the 50 healthiest foods you can buy at the supermarket.\nThe post 9 Health Benefits of Beets (and Risks) You Never Knew About appeared first on The Healthy.","2":"Adding colorful beets to your diet can be a visually appealing way to pack some extra nutrition into your favorite dishes.\nFrom reducing inflammation to improving heart health, beets provide many health benefits.\nThe stark red color of beets comes from compounds called betalains.\nBeets are also rich in nitrates, which reduce inflammation by removing harmful compounds from your bloodstream.\nThis combination of betalains and nitrates makes beets a great choice for people with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia.\nThe nitrates in beets don't just reduce inflammation, they also improve heart health.\nBeets are also naturally low in cholesterol and fat, which makes them a good option for people concerned about heart disease or stroke.\nStudies have shown that the nitrates in beets help these cellular powerhouses function better.\nBeets are a nutrient-dense root vegetable low in calories, fat, and cholesterol, making them a heart-healthy choice.\nBeets can also be added to smoothies with other fruits and vegetables to help sweeten the taste."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-beets","1":"www.msn.com\/en-us\/health\/nutrition\/9-health-benefits-of-beets-and-risks-you-never-knew-about\/ar-BB1fdxmj","2":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-beets"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
