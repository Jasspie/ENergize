pesticides have not been used, be sure to buy Non-GMO\/organic, as toxic, chemical pesticides contaminate air, water, soil, etc.\nYes, raspberries are plant based since it is a fruit.\nPlant based foods include fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds that are best when fresh and unprocessed.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".* High blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is less common among\u00a0vegans.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nRaspberries are a type of fruit, therefore making it a gluten free food.\nDo raspberries have a high or low water footprint?\nRaspberries have a relatively low water footprint.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nDo raspberries have a high or low carbon footprint?\nRaspberries have a relatively low carbon footprint.\nIt takes around 0.27 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of fresh raspberries, a car driving equivalent of 0.75 miles or 1.25 kilometers, USA market data.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nRaspberry production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nRaspberries are a fruit and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day

estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nAre raspberries a product that has known labor issues?\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"The environmental effects of seasonal food supply have been explored through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of raspberries supplied to UK consumers at different times of year.\nSupply of raspberries at different times of the year draws on different production systems and locations.\nDespite that, the results of this LCA, based on data from individual producers, reveal relatively small differences in impacts for different times of supply, except in the case of the water footprint measures.\nSo in this case, yield and agricultural practice appear stronger drivers of the environmental burden of food production than is time of supply.","2":"Raspberry production can be a good fit for small farms, as a small planting of raspberries can provide significant income and equipment needs are quite modest.\nRaspberry plantings should fruit for at least five years and occasionally produce for more than ten years.\nRaspberry plantings should fruit for at least five years and occasionally produce for more than ten years.\nInitial investment in a planting is relatively high, good management skills are needed to produce a quality product, and substantial labor is required.\nRed raspberries have chilling requirements that limit their production to cooler regions of the United States.\nUnder high-tunnel production, growers have the potential to produce higher yields and better quality fruit, but they must also consider the significant costs for the tunnel and higher level of management required.\nCanada is a major producer of red raspberries, with most of the production located in British Columbia and Ontario.\nSix basic marketing alternatives are available to the raspberry grower: wholesale markets, cooperatives, local retailers, roadside stands, pick-your-own operations, and processing firms.\nBecause raspberries are so perishable, they are well suited to marketing channels where a short period of time is spent in the \"pipeline\" from the producer to the consumer, such as roadside stands and pick-your-own operations.\nRecently, however, there has been an increased interest in locally produced raspberries for their use in fruit wines, which can be an outlet for excess fruit.\nFruit can also be frozen for later use in locally produced value-added processed products.\nFor more information on marketing, consult Fruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Part-time Growers\u00a0and Developing a Roadside Market.\nPrices growers have reported obtaining for fresh-market red raspberries vary tremendously depending on location--from as little as $1.50 per pound pick-your-own in rural locations, to as high as $5.00 per ready-picked half-pint clamshell in locations near population centers.\nProcessed raspberry prices in traditional outlets typically have been only one-third to one-half that obtained for fresh-market berries.\nPotential growers should conduct a quick survey of local prices for red raspberries before establishing their plantings.\nWhile high prices can be obtained for red raspberries, these delicate fruits are susceptible to numerous diseases and insects (including spotted wing drosophila, a new invasive fruit fly that infests the fruit), require a great deal of labor for hand-harvesting fresh-market fruit (machine harvest is an option only for berries that will be processed), and have a very short shelf life.\nTherefore, the production of a good crop from year to year requires careful management.\nRed raspberries grow best on sunny sites with well-drained soil.\nAlso, red raspberry plantings should not follow Verticillium-susceptible crops, such as peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, or strawberries.\nCover cropping for at least a year with rye or sudangrass is a highly recommended practice that will help control weeds prior to planting the raspberries.\nThe red raspberry plant has one of two growth habits: summer bearing or everbearing.\nSummer-bearing (also referred to as floricane-fruiting) are the most common type of raspberry in the bramble family.\nIn the first year of planting, vegetative canes are produced.\nThe following year, these same canes flower and produce fruit.\nWhile they are flowering and fruiting, new vegetative canes (\"suckers\") are produced from buds on the roots and grow throughout the summer.\nFruiting canes die shortly after producing that year's crop.\nTherefore, a mature raspberry planting has two types of canes: vegetative canes that originated during the current year (primocanes), and fruiting canes that originated during the previous year (floricanes).\nEverbearing (also referred to as primocane-fruiting or fall-bearing) raspberries produce primocanes that are capable of flowering and fruiting in the same year that they are produced.\nBecause the canes don't reach their mature length until mid-summer, fruiting is later than for summer-bearing raspberries.\nThe canes of primocane-bearing raspberry plants are usually mowed to the ground every winter because the next year's crop does not require the previous season's canes.\nHowever, if the canes are not removed, they will produce a small summer crop from previously unbroken fruit buds low on the cane and, hence, are sometimes referred to as \"everbearers.\" Some commonly grown cultivars of summer-bearing red raspberries are Boyne (early season), Nova (mid-season), and Taylor (late season).\nThe presence of spotted wing drosophila is making production of fall fruit on everbearers exceedingly difficult, so growers are encouraged to choose summer-bearing varieties, which are largely finished fruiting by the time this pest is present.\nBoth summer-bearing and everbearing cultivars readily produce new shoots from the roots (called \"suckering\").\nRed raspberries usually are planted 24 inches apart in rows that are 8 to 12 feet apart.\nPlants will produce many suckers in the first year.\nSome pests, such as spotted wing drosophila, affect the fruit, while others, such as cane borers, attack the plant.\nMany pest problems can be avoided through proper site selection, crop rotation, variety selection, soil treatment, and by planting disease-free plants.\nWeeds must be controlled in a raspberry planting.\nWith summer-bearing red raspberries, the first significant crop is usually obtained during the third year after planting.\nPrimocane-bearing plants usually yield a significant crop in the second year.\nAt maturity (about four years old), plants should produce about 5,000 pounds of fruit per acre, though not all will be harvested in pick-your-own fields.\nBecause of the extremely short shelf life of red raspberries, good postharvest practices are essential.\nRed raspberries must be picked and handled very carefully.\nIf harvested at the proper time and handled carefully, raspberries will remain in good condition for several days.\nIn the normal course of operations, farmers handle pesticides and other chemicals, may have manure to collect and spread, and use equipment to prepare fields and harvest crops.\nContact your soil and water conservation district, extension office, zoning board, state departments of agriculture and environmental protection, and your local governing authorities to determine what regulations may pertain to your operation.\nAlso, several major food distribution chains are beginning to require GAP- and GHP-certified products from their producers.\nYou will need to have any water supply used by your workers or for crop irrigation and pesticide application checked at least twice each year.\nFor more information about GAPs and GHPs, contact your local extension office or your state's Department of Agriculture.\nThere are crop insurance programs designed to help farmers manage both yield risk and revenue shortfalls.\nIf individual coverage is not available for what you grow, you may be able to use the AGR\/AGR-Lite program to insure the revenue of your entire farm operation.\nFor more information concerning crop insurance, contact a crop insurance agent or check the Penn State Extension website.\nFinally, the USDA Farm Service Agency has a program called the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP) that is designed to provide a minimal level of yield risk protection for producers of commercial agricultural products that don't have multi-peril crop insurance coverage.\nIncluded in this publication are five annual budgets for red raspberry production.\nThe first summarizes the costs of land preparation, the second covers establishment of the red raspberry planting, and the third summarizes costs and returns for the year after planting.\nThe fourth summarizes the costs and returns for a mature (four-year-old) red raspberry planting for retail marketing.\nThese years would have fewer receipts and lower harvest costs than a mature planting.\nWhile the budgets are calculated for one acre of production, a beginning grower should start much smaller.\nMore information on the use of crop budgets can be found in Budgeting for Agricultural Decision Making.\nYou can use the red Clear Form button to clear all the information from your budget when you are finished.\nFruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Parttime Growers.\nIrrigation for Fruit and

snacks.\nOne cup of raspberries provides over 50% of the minimum daily target for vitamin C, which supports immunity and skin health and helps produce collagen.\nRaspberries are also one of the lowest-sugar fruits, at just 5 grams per cup fresh, compared to about 20 grams in one medium apple.\nRaspberry antioxidants also help reduce inflammation, a known trigger of premature aging.\nRaspberry antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds are associated with cancer protection by reducing the reproduction of cancer cells.\nA cup of raspberries packs an impressive 8 grams of dietary fiber, a third of the daily minimum goal.\nResearchers found that for those who were at risk of diabetes, eating more raspberries reduced the amount of insulin needed to manage blood sugar levels.\nIn fact, blood sugar was lower in those who downed two cups of red raspberries compared to those who ate none.\nWhip frozen raspberries into smoothies, or thaw and use just like fresh.\nFrozen, thawed, or fresh raspberries also make a great snack, paired with nuts, pumpkin seeds, or a few dark chocolate squares, or drizzled with nut butter or spiced tahini.","1":"Raspberries are high in several powerful antioxidant compounds, including vitamin C, quercetin and ellagic acid (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nCompared to other berries, raspberries have a similar antioxidant content as strawberries, but only half as much as blackberries and a quarter as much as blueberries (5Trusted Source).\nA review of animal studies suggests that raspberries and raspberry extracts have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects that may reduce your risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer (6Trusted Source).\nOne eight-week study in obese, diabetic mice observed that those fed freeze-dried red raspberry showed fewer signs of inflammation and oxidative stress than the control group (7Trusted Source).\nRaspberries are high in antioxidants, plant compounds that protect against cell damage.\nIn animal studies, mice fed freeze-dried red raspberries alongside a high-fat diet had lower blood sugar levels and less insulin resistance than the control group (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nThe raspberry-fed mice also demonstrated less evidence of fatty liver disease (9Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, raspberries are high in tannins, which block alpha-amylase, a digestive enzyme necessary for breaking down starch (11Trusted Source).\nBerry extracts \u2014 including those of red raspberries \u2014 block the growth of and destroy cancer cells in test-tube studies on colon, prostate, breast and oral (mouth) cancer cells (12Trusted Source).\nIn one test-tube study, red raspberry extract was shown to kill up to 90% of stomach, colon and breast cancer cells (13Trusted Source).\nAnother test-tube study demonstrated that sanguiin H-6 \u2014 an antioxidant found in red raspberries \u2014 led to cell death in over 40% of ovarian cancer cells (14Trusted Source).\nAnimal studies with raspberries also observe protective effects against cancer.\nIn one 10-week study on mice with colitis, those fed a diet of 5% red raspberries had less inflammation and a lower risk of cancer than the control group (15Trusted Source).\nIn another study, red raspberry extract prevented the growth of liver cancers in mice.\nBecause raspberries are high in many nutrients and antioxidants, they may provide other health benefits as well.\nRaspberries have anti-inflammatory properties which may reduce symptoms of arthritis (6Trusted Source).\nIn one study, rats treated with red raspberry extract had a lower risk of arthritis than rats in the control group.\nIn another study in rats, those given raspberry extract had less swelling and joint destruction than the control group (18Trusted Source).\nIn one study, mice were fed a low-fat diet, a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with one of eight berries, including raspberries.\nMice in the raspberry group gained less weight than mice only on a high-fat diet (21Trusted Source).\nIn one animal study, mice fed a high-fat diet and given high doses of raspberry ketones gained less weight than mice in the control group (22Trusted Source).\nThe only human-based study on raspberry ketones and weight loss used a supplement containing several other substances, including caffeine, making it impossible to determine whether raspberry ketones were responsible for any positive effects (23Trusted Source).\nRaspberries are high in antioxidants, which can help reduce signs of aging by fighting free radicals in your body.\nIn one eight-week study, aging rats fed a diet with 1% or 2% raspberries showed improved motor functions, including balance and strength (24Trusted Source).\nRaspberries may reduce arthritis risk, aid weight loss and decrease signs of aging.\nRaspberries are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nThis is a detailed review of Raspberry Ketones, a popular weight loss supplement that has been shown to be effective in animal studies.","2":"And, each delicate raspberry is packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.\nRaspberries can be found in four different colors: red, black, purple, and gold.\nOne cup of raspberries provides 8 grams of fiber, far more than most fruits in the produce aisle.\nRaspberries contain much less sugar than most fruits \u2014 just 5 grams in an entire cup, making them less likely to raise your blood sugar levels.\nRaspberries add a sweet taste to dishes, which can reduce your desire to sweeten food with artificial preservatives helping you lose weight and control your blood sugar levels.\nRaspberries are high in antioxidants that can protect cells from damage by free radicals.\nBlack raspberries offer the most antioxidants, followed by red and then golden raspberries.\nRaspberries also contain Vitamin C, which is vital to collagen production, a protein that makes up 75% of your skin.\nRaspberries are loaded with Vitamin C, which may also help prevent and repair skin damage from the sun.\nThe same amount of plain Greek yogurt and \u00bd cup of raspberries provides almost double the amount of food with only 14 grams of carbs and less than 10 grams of sugar.\nEach of the four types of raspberries \u2014 red, black, purple, and gold \u2014\u00a0are distinct in taste.\nPurple raspberries are a cross between the red and black."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.health.com\/food\/raspberries-nutrition","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/raspberry-nutrition","2":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-raspberries"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
