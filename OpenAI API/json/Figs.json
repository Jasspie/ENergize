benefits.\nThey may promote healthy digestion, decrease your risk of heart disease, and help you manage your blood sugar levels.\nFigs have many potential benefits, including promoting digestive and heart health, along with potentially helping manage blood sugar levels.\nThey contain fiber, which may help promote digestive health by softening and adding bulk to stools, decreasing constipation, and serving as a prebiotic \u2014 or food source for the healthy bacteria populating your gut (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nIn animal studies, fig fruit extract or paste helped speed the movement of food through the digestive tract, reducing constipation and improving the symptoms of digestive disorders like ulcerative colitis (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nA study in 150 people with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) found that those who consumed about 4 dried figs (45 grams) twice daily experienced a significant reduction in symptoms \u2014 including pain, bloating, and constipation \u2014 compared with a control group (9Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, a similar study in 80 people found that supplementing with about 10 ounces (300 grams) of fig fruit paste daily for 8 weeks significantly decreased constipation, compared with a control group (10Trusted Source).\nFigs may improve blood pressure and blood fat levels, which can help improve your vascular health and decrease your risk of heart disease.\nOne study found that fig extract decreased blood pressure in rats with normal blood pressure, as well as those with elevated levels (11Trusted Source).\nAnimal studies have also shown improvements in total cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when supplementing with fig leaf extract (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nHowever, in a 5-week study in 83 people with high LDL (bad) cholesterol, researchers noted that those who added about 14 dried figs (120 grams) to their diet daily had no changes in blood fat levels, compared with a control group (14Trusted Source).\nMore human studies are needed to better understand the relationship between figs and heart health.\nOne dated study from 1998 in 10 people with type 1 diabetes found that having fig leaf tea with breakfast may have decreased their insulin needs.\nIn the month they received fig leaf tea, their insulin doses decreased by about 12% (15Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, a more recent study found that drinks containing high doses of fig fruit extract had a lower glycemic index (GI) than beverages with no fig fruit extract, meaning these drinks would have a more favorable effect on blood sugar levels (16Trusted Source).\nIf you have trouble managing your blood sugar levels, you should limit your intake of dried figs.\nOne study in 45 children with dermatitis found that a cream made from dried fig fruit extract applied twice daily for 2 weeks was more effective at treating the symptoms of dermatitis than hydrocortisone cream, the standard treatment (21Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, a combination of fruit extracts \u2014 including fig extract \u2014 was shown to exhibit antioxidant effects on skin cells, decrease collagen breakdown, and improve the appearance of wrinkles in a test-tube and animal study (22Trusted Source).\nThey may improve digestion and decrease constipation, help manage blood fat and blood sugar levels, and kill cancer cells.\nFor instance, as they\u2019re sometimes used as a home remedy for constipation, figs may cause diarrhea or other digestive problems (10Trusted Source).\nFigs are also fairly rich in vitamin K, which can interfere with blood thinning medications and cause them to be less effective (1Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nIf you\u2019re on a blood thinner, you should keep your intake of figs and other vitamin-K-rich foods consistent from day to day to decrease your risk of complications (23Trusted Source).\nFig trees also contain natural latex, which some people may be allergic to (24Trusted Source).\nHere are the four main ways you can include figs in your diet: You can enjoy figs in a variety of ways, but due to their high sugar content, you should only eat dried figs in moderation or use them as an occasional home treatment for constipation.","1":"One reason many healthy eating websites feature food with figs is that figs satisfy sweet cravings while also providing many important health benefits.\nHere are some of the health benefits you can expect to enjoy when you eat figs.\nOne factor that leads to high blood pressure is a potassium imbalance caused by eating too much sodium and not enough potassium.\nFigs are a potassium-rich food and can help correct that imbalance.\nMeanwhile, high levels of fiber in figs can help to flush excess sodium from the system.\nIn addition to their high fiber content, however, figs aid digestion in another way.\nThey are an excellent source of prebiotics, which improve overall gut health.\nStudies suggest that a potassium-rich diet, in particular, can improve bone health and reduce bone turnover.\nThey are also an excellent source of: Although figs are healthy in moderation, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that a serving size is one medium fig.\nAlways be mindful of the amount of figs in the foods you eat and limit yourself to keep your overall sugar intake low.","2":"Figs have a long, interesting past and a number of great health benefits.\nThus, 100 grams of raw figs nutrition contains about: (1) Figs nutrition contains many vitamins and minerals that provide health benefits to a number of bodily systems.\nBecause oxidation affects almost all body systems, the damage it causes has been linked to many major diseases, aging and cancer\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as high-antioxidant foods, figs help stave off these conditions.\n(6) Studies also show that properly dried figs can be an even better source of phenolic compounds and have increased levels of antioxidant activity than their raw or improperly dried counterparts.\n(7) This is probably why figs were revered throughout history; easily stored, dried figs could provide incredible health benefits for long voyages and dry climates that prevented access to fresh fruit.\nFigs have a reputation in traditional medicine as a remedy for many health problems, including as a natural cancer treatment.\nFor instance, a study by the Department of Natural Medicinal Chemistry at China Pharmaceutical University shows that some elements contained in figs are toxic to various human cancer cell lines.\nStudies have shown figs to be a good source of treatment for anemia, cancer, diabetes, leprosy, liver disease, paralysis, skin diseases, ulcers, gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract infections, and more.\nA review by the Drug and Herbal Research Centre at the Universiti Kebangsaan in Malaysia cited two studies that showed fig extract\u2019s ability to combat a strand of oral bacteria, as well as various fungi and microbes.\n(11) There are also studies conducted in grass carp that shows effectiveness in figs\u2019 ability to stimulate immune system response, thus making figs tremendous immune system boosters.\nFigs are a high-fiber food whether raw or dried, while they also provide anywhere from 7 percent to 19 percent of your daily potassium intake depending on how they\u2019re prepared \u2014 thus, eating figs helps\u00a0overcome low potassium levels.\nDried figs nutrition is also great sources of manganese, magnesium and calcium, all of which also don\u2019t appear in our diets as much as they should.\nIf you are lucky enough to have access to a fig tree, the leaves of the trees are also incredibly valuable to your health, mostly due to their antioxidant abilities.\nThe leaves can be dried and made into teas or extracts, which is very common in areas of the world with substantial fig tree growth.\nPreliminary studies show\u00a0reduction of glucose in the blood of rats when given an extract made from fig tree leaves.\n(13, 14) Fig fruit has also been proven as a powerful treatment for the side effects of diabetes.\nWith anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, figs are able to normalize many bodily functions sometimes damaged by diabetes, making them a potential diabetes natural remedy.\n(15) Fig leaves are great providers of bioactive compounds that are great at fighting\u00a0free radical damage.\n(16) As a result, some studies have used information about the makeup of the fig leaf to develop better forms of photodynamic therapy to treat certain types of skin cancer.\n(17) There have been multiple studies using fig tree leaf extract (combined with other fruits and alone)\u00a0that\u00a0have shown successful examples of anti-wrinkle capabilities.\nFig trees produce a natural latex sap that is also used for a number of practical and medicinal purposes.\nFigs were so popular among the Greeks that there were even laws made to prevent exportation, and\u00a0they\u2019re an essential element in the Mediterranean diet, which is one of the healthiest diets in the world.\nAnd unlike many other fruits and vegetables, studies have shown that the health benefits of figs actually increase after drying.\nDrying figs can extend their shelf life and provide healthy snacks on the go.\nWhen properly stored, dried figs can last 18 to 24 months.\nHere are a few of my favorites: People with skin and allergies to mulberry, natural rubber latex or weeping fig could have potential reactions to fig tree components, such as the fruit and leaves.\nPeople with diabetes should be cautious when consuming or using figs medicinally, as they have effects on glucose levels in the blood."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/figs-benefits","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-figs","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/figs-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
