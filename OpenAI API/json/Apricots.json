the national levels.\nProcessing leads to high impacts of fruit juices, dried and frozen products.\nPackaging used for canned fruits and juices is also a significant contributor to the impacts.\nTaking the annual consumption into account, the whole UK fruit sector generates 7.9\u202fMt CO2 eq.\nOranges, bananas and apples are responsible for more than half of the impacts at the national level as they account for 64% of the total fruit consumption in the UK.","1":"For the current production scenario, life cycle environmental footprints of F&V supply chain are discussed considering the influences of: agro-climates, production systems, raw material inputs, post-harvest managements to the products' yield and quality.\nIt also discusses potential adaptation and mitigation measures to CC, and therefrom argues on the related environmental consequences in the supply chain.\nThe nexus among the climatic stresses, potential adaptation and mitigation measures, hence were in the form of potential changes in the raw material inputs and resource flows depending on the preferred future agro-management strategies and farming practices.\nProspective life cycle environmental evaluation of F&V supply chain considering the relationship among product yield and qualities, CC stresses and potential adaptation and mitigation measures is thus a new thrust and direction.","2":"The environmental impact of fruits, berries, vegetables and legumes varies greatly depending on how and where they are grown and how delicate they are.\nCoarse, hardy vegetables \u2013 like root vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower and onion \u2013 are often grown on open land and therefore affect the climate less than vegetables that are cultivated in greenhouses.\nCoarse vegetables can also be stored for longer than more delicate vegetables such as tomato, lettuce and cucumber.Fruits and vegetables that have been produced with little or no pesticides, such as organic alternatives, contribute to a non-toxic environment.Longer shipping distances often result in more greenhouse gas emissions than shorter ones, but the mode of transport is also significant.\nDid you know......that sensitive fruits and vegetables that spoil quickly, like berries and fresh legumes, are often transported by air if they are shipped long distances?\nWe can reduce wastage by storing them correctly so that they keep longer and by not buying more than we can use....that beans, lentils and peas have a relatively low environmental impact \u2013 especially when they replace meat?\nSensitive fruits and vegetables need to be kept refrigerated during transport, which further increases greenhouse gas emissions.Coarse, hardy vegetables \u2013 like root vegetables, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and onion \u2013 affect the climate less than salad vegetables such as tomato, lettuce and cucumber.\nThey can also be stored for a long time, which reduces wastage both at the shop and at home.In countries that have a colder climate, salad vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce, are often grown in greenhouses.\nHowever, this is still not so common for other salad vegetables.Legumes, such as beans, peas and lentils, also have a relatively low environmental impact.\nThey are also rich in protein and can therefore replace some of our meat consumption, which has a much greater environmental impact.As fruits and berries are mostly grown in the open, the emission of greenhouse gases comes primarily from transportation, refrigeration and the use of fertilisers."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301479719308035","1":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969718338920","2":"www.livsmedelsverket.se\/en\/food-habits-health-and-environment\/food-and-environment\/eco-smart-food-choice\/fruit-berries-and-vegetables"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

fight free radicals in your body (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s best to enjoy apricots whole and unpeeled, as the skin boasts large amounts of fiber and nutrients.\nApricots are a great source of many antioxidants, including beta carotene and vitamins A, C, and E.\nWhat\u2019s more, they\u2019re high in a group of polyphenol antioxidants called flavonoids, which have been shown to protect against illnesses, including diabetes and heart disease (5, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nHigh flavonoid intake was also tied to a 56% lower oxidative stress score (11Trusted Source).\nApricots boast multiple compounds that are essential for eye health, including vitamins A and E (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nVitamin A plays a vital role in preventing night blindness, a disorder caused by lack of light pigments in your eyes, while vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that enters your eyes directly to protect them from free radical damage (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, beta carotene \u2014 which gives apricots their yellow-orange color \u2014 serves as a precursor to vitamin A, meaning that your body can convert it into this vitamin (14Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, research indicates a direct link between ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, sunburns, and your risk of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nNotably, you can fight some of this skin damage through a healthy diet full of antioxidants, which apricots provide.\nIn particular, vitamin

diet.\nThis article lists four potential health benefits of apricots, takes a look at their nutritional value, and suggests a few ways in which people can add the fruit to their diet.\nExperts recommend that people eat lots of fruits and vegetables, since they are high in the vitamins and minerals that our bodies need to thrive.\nSpecifically, vitamin A helps the body make the pigments it needs for the retina to work properly.\nVitamin A also helps the eyes produce the moisture they need to stay properly lubricated.\nAccording to some research, people in the United States only get around 16 gTrusted Source of the 25\u201338 g of fiber they need every day.\nFresh fruits and vegetables, including apricots, are excellent sources of fiber.\nSome studies have shownTrusted Source that freezing or canning apricots does not seem to reduce their nutritional value.\nIt is important to note that people should eat a range of fruits and vegetables, as part of a balanced diet, to make sure that they are getting all the nutrients their bodies need.\nLike most fruits and vegetables, apricots are a good source of many of the vitamins and minerals that our bodies need to
