process, to the amount of fuel and water required to bring the food from farm to table.\n\u201cPeople want to purchase something that\u2019s more sustainable and naturally delicious that hasn\u2019t just been cultivated for shelf life or other properties.\u201d In fact, a federal law mandating labeling of all products containing GMOs goes into effect this year.\n\u201cWild Blueberries are really a very low-input crop relative to most others,\u201d said Dr. David Yarborough, Wild Blueberry specialist and professor of horticulture at the University of Maine.\nThey are commercially harvested only in Maine and Eastern Canada\u2014where they began growing when the glaciers receded,14,000 years ago.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re here naturally, we don\u2019t have the disturbance of the soil involved in planting as in cultivated blueberries,\u201d said Yarborough.\n\u201cWe are not taking land out of nature but managing the natural resource that already exists.\u201d Wild Blueberries have evolved in extreme growing conditions.\n\u201cThe coast of Maine glaciers provided the proper environment; the climate and soil conditions are just right for Wild Blueberries,\u201d said Yarborough.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where they\u2019ve flourished for thousands of years.\u201d And because pests can\u2019t survive well in the harsh climate where Wild Blueberries are harvested, there\u2019s less need for pesticides and chemicals than there are warm-climate crops.\nWild Blueberry harvesters are continually developing better sustainable growing techniques.\n\u201cThat enables us to drastically reduce pest-management inputs, and use much fewer pesticides than most modern cultivated crops,\u201d said Yarborough.\nWhat\u2019s more, Wild Blueberry growers are leveraging emerging pest-monitoring methods in order to reduce the small amount of pesticides they use.\nBecause Wild Blueberries have evolved over centuries in areas where there\u2019s less than one inch of rain per week, they don\u2019t need as much water as other crops.","1":"Traditionally, plants have needed environments similar to these, which provide enough hours of cold temperatures to produce good fruit set.\nIn states such as California that cannot supply enough \u201cchill hours\u201d to support conventionally grown blueberries, horticulturists have bred newer varieties that adapt to warmer environments, if their other needs are also met.\nNew hybrid crosses of southern highbush and rabbiteye selections have yielded plants with higher tolerances for growing in more temperate environments.\nAs tree roots grow, they deplete water and nutrient reserves in soil from blueberries.\nBlueberry roots have three major requirements of soil: acidic pH, loose substrate and moist, but well-draining sites.\nBlueberries need moist soil that does not become waterlogged.\nSufficient water is not only important during fruit development, but it is also needed to set new current-season buds that flower the following season.\nSince blueberry plants set these new buds during the hottest part of summer, gardeners in Mediterranean climates, which receive little rainfall in summer, must provide supplemental water.","2":"Life cycle impacts of Chilean fresh and U.S. frozen blueberries were compared.\nTherefore, in this study, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of Chilean fresh organic blueberries and frozen organic blueberries produced in two representative states in the U.S. This cradle-to-consumer LCA covered the farming and harvesting, processing, transportation, and storage stages.\nThe farming and harvesting, postharvest processing, and transportation were identified as the environmental impact hotspots.\nWhether consumers should choose the frozen or fresh blueberries was found to be highly sensitive to the length of frozen storage and the type of refrigerant used."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.foodprocessing.com\/articles\/2018\/wild-blueberries-reduce-carbon-footprint\/","1":"homeguides.sfgate.com\/environment-blueberries-grow-44532.html","2":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959652619302562"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

per Serving, Preparation Information, and More"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Antioxidants protect your body from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage your cells and contribute to aging and diseases, such as cancer (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\nOne group of flavonoids in particular \u2014 anthocyanins \u2014 is thought to be responsible for much of these berries\u2019 beneficial health effects (7Trusted Source).\nBlueberries have been shown to directly increase antioxidant levels in your body (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\nAfter four weeks, oxidative DNA damage due to free radicals was reduced by 20% (12Trusted Source).\nThe antioxidants in blueberries are strongly linked to reduced levels of oxidized LDL.\nThis makes blueberries very good for your heart (15Trusted Source).\nA daily 2-ounce (50-gram) serving of blueberries lowered LDL oxidation by 27% over eight weeks in obese people who were obese (16Trusted Source).\nAnother study determined that eating 2.5 ounces (75 grams) of blueberries with a main meal significantly reduced the oxidation of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol (17Trusted Source).\nBlueberries appear to have significant benefits for people with high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.\nIn an eight-week study, obese people who had had a high risk of heart disease noted a 4\u20136% reduction in blood pressure after consuming 2 ounces (50 grams) of blueberries per day (18Trusted Source).\nOther studies have observed similar effects \u2014 especially for postmenopausal women (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nWhile eating blueberries may lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL cholesterol, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are risk factors \u2014 not actual diseases.\nIt would be much more informative to know whether blueberries help prevent hard endpoints like heart attacks, which are the world\u2019s leading cause of death (21Trusted Source).\nA study in 93,600 nurses found that those with the highest intake of anthocyanins \u2014 the main antioxidants in blueberries \u2014 were at a 32% lower risk of heart attacks compared to those with the lowest intake (22Trusted Source).\nAccording to animal studies, the antioxidants in blueberries may affect areas of your brain that are essential for intelligence (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nAfter 12 weeks, they experienced improvements in several markers of brain function (25Trusted Source).\nA six-year study in over 16,000 older individuals found that blueberries and strawberries were linked to delays in mental aging by up to 2.5 years (26Trusted Source).\nThese anti-diabetes effects occur with both blueberry juice and extract (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29).\nIn a study in 32 obese people with insulin resistance, two blueberry smoothies daily caused major improvements in insulin sensitivity (30Trusted Source).\nImproved insulin sensitivity should lower the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which are currently two of the world\u2019s biggest health problems.\nBecause blueberries are closely related to cranberries, they boast many of the same active substances as cranberry juice (31Trusted Source).\nBlueberries have rarely been studied for their impact on UTIs, but they likely have similar effects as cranberries (32Trusted Source).\nIn a small study in 10 female athletes, blueberries accelerated muscle recovery after strenuous leg exercises (34Trusted Source).\nBerries taste great and may have many health benefits, including preventing and reducing symptoms of chronic disease.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.","1":"They\u2019re low in calories and incredibly healthy, potentially regulating blood sugar levels and aiding heart and brain health.\nBlueberries are low in calories and fat yet provide decent amounts of healthy fiber.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of raw blueberries has (3Trusted Source): Blueberries primarily consist of 14% carbs, 84% water, and small amounts of protein and fat.\nThese berries have a score of 53 on the glycemic index (GI), which measures how quickly certain foods raise blood sugar levels (4).\nDietary fiber is an important part of a healthy diet and may have protective effects against various diseases (5Trusted Source).\nBlueberries are rich in beneficial plant compounds and antioxidants \u2014 especially anthocyanins \u2014 which may account for many of their health benefits.\nStudies note a relationship between berries \u2014 or flavonoid-rich foods \u2014 and improved heart health (20Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nSome research suggests that blueberries may have significant health benefits for people with high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nThese berries may also inhibit the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol \u2014 a critical step in the heart disease process (23Trusted Source).\nAn observational study in 93,600 nurses found that a high intake of anthocyanins was linked to a 32% lower risk of heart attacks (24Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, a higher intake of flavonoid-rich foods like blueberries has been associated with better brain function (25Trusted Source).\nAnother, six-year study in older adults found that blueberries and strawberries were linked to delays in brain aging by up to two and a half years (28Trusted Source).\nPeople with diabetes are sensitive to rapid changes in blood sugar and need to be cautious when they eat foods rich in carbs.\nHowever, they don\u2019t have adverse effects on blood sugar levels, which may be due to their high content of bioactive compounds.\nTest-tube studies suggest that the anthocyanins in blueberries can have beneficial effects on blood sugar control (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nOne six-week study found that two blueberry smoothies daily helped improve insulin sensitivity in obese people who were at a high risk of developing diabetes (32Trusted Source).\nBlueberries may decrease your risk of heart disease, boost brain health, lower blood sugar levels, and improve insulin sensitivity.\nThey\u2019re a good source of vitamin K1, vitamin C, manganese, and several other beneficial plant compounds like anthocyanins.\nEating blueberries on a regular basis may prevent heart disease, improve brain health, and help moderate blood sugar levels.\nHere are 10 evidence-based health benefits of\u2026 Fruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants.\nFor people with diabetes\u2026 Berries taste great and may have many health benefits, including preventing and reducing symptoms of chronic disease.\nDried fruit is very nutritious, but also contains a lot of sugar and calories.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.","2":"Blueberries contain vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that provide notable health benefits.\nFor example, blueberries are rich in vitamin K, which plays an important role in promoting heart health.\nEating blueberries regularly for just two weeks can help reduce damage to your cells by as much as 20%.\nAntioxidants in blueberries help prevent cholesterol in your blood from being oxidized and may even help keep cholesterol from building up in the first place.\nEating blueberries regularly can help reduce high blood pressure in people with metabolic syndrome and protect cardiovascular health.\nThe current hypothesis is that blueberries help the body produce more nitric oxide, which reduces blood pressure inside blood vessels and helps with smooth muscle relaxation.\nBlueberries can help people with diabetes better manage their blood sugar levels.\nStudies have shown that eating blueberries regularly can help improve insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes.\nBlueberries can also help reduce fasting blood sugar levels by nearly a third in people with type 2 diabetes, helping them to manage their blood sugar levels more effectively.\nAnthocyanins are responsible for blueberry juice\u2019s rich purple color and have shown promise in helping to reduce signs of aging, risk of cancer, and damage to DNA."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/blueberries","2":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-blueberries"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
