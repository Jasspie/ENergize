drought.\nDesperate for water\u00a0and unable to probe the dry, hardened forest floor for moisture-rich insects, young kiwi were venturing into exposed paddocks to find food.\nIt\u2019s a problem Whangarei Native Bird Recovery Centre\u2019s Robert Webb has seen in recent dry summers and it\u2019s unlikely to stop.\nClimate change predictions say in the coming years the region will spend double the time in drought as it does now.\nWith the forest floors rock hard, kiwi are attracted to the dew on farm paddocks.\n\u201cThe kiwi just keep walking, walking, walking and all of a sudden daylight comes along and they\u2019re way out in the middle of a paddock.\nThen of course the heat of the day comes and dehydrates them and they die.\u201d As well as in paddocks Webb said kiwi have been found raiding cat bowls and attempting to drink water dripping from parked machinery.\nOver a three-week period eight dehydrated kiwi were brought to the recovery center, mostly by farmers investigating an odd \u201cblob\u201d spotted in the paddock when moving stock.\nWhen droughts come kiwi chicks in particular struggle.\nAdult kiwi are stronger making foraging, even during droughts when the ground is rock hard, easier.\nBased on the current trajectory\u00a0and sticking with\u00a0business as usual with\u00a0no emission reductions during the 21st century, time spent in drought, where the ground gets too hard for kiwi to probe will double.\nBackyard Kiwi project manager\u00a0Todd Hamilton said the population can cope with the occasional drought.\nHamilton said in his area in the Whangarei Heads the kiwi population has grown from 80 in 2001 to around 900.\nStoats kill kiwi chicks and when the local stoats got too clever for the traps 1080 (a rodenticide) was used.\n\u201cOur forests are healthier, they grow more leaves, have more leaf litter and everything spirals upwards.\u201d It\u2019s not just drought which affects whether kiwi can get to food.\nThe canopy vacuum left allows sunlight to stream onto the normally shady forest floor, drying and hardening it.\nAs well as letting the sun dry out the forest floor, the dead trees aren\u2019t dropping all important leaves because they\u2019ve ended up in possums\u2019 stomachs.\nWithout the possums dropped leaves would have become leaf litter, insulation for the forest floor and home to all manner of insect life.\nThey can probe down quite deep and the need to get bugs through the leaf litter and down into the worm layers.\u201d Last year the Department of Conservation dropped 1080 on the Russell Forest and Rakaumangamanga\/Cape Brett for the first time in decades.\nPossum numbers dropped to a fifth of what they had been in Russell Forest, and a 10th of previous levels in Rakaumangamanga\/Cape Brett.\nNot only the trees but the bird life.\u201d Robert Webb and his wife have been rescuing native birds for 35 years.\nAll these things are hurting the birds.\u201d Each year about 1300 birds are brought to the centre ranging from albatross to kiwi chicks.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping we\u2019re not going to have a stinking hot summer because it\u2019s going to play havoc on the kiwi chicks.\u201d If business as usual continues, climate change is likely to bring more stinking hot summers to Northland.","1":"Because it manages one-third of New Zealand\u2019s land mass, including the five kiwi sanctuaries, the Department of Conservation (DOC) is a key player in protecting kiwi habitat.\nCommunity-led kiwi conservation groups\u00a0are also big players, with more than 80 now established throughout New Zealand, protecting tens of thousands of hectares.\nMany forest owners and managers\u00a0are also doing their bit to protect the kiwi that make a home among their trees.\nCreating pest and predator-free sanctuaries brings benefits for many of New Zealand\u2019s other native plants and animals, as well as kiwi.\nPossums not only disturb kiwi nests, they also eat Powelliphanta (New Zealand\u2019s giant carnivorous land snail) and the eggs and chicks of many other native birds.\nStoats are as deadly for native insects, bats and other native birds as they are for kiwi.","2":"Either your web browser doesn't support Javascript or it is currently turned off.\nturn on Javascript support in your web browser and reload this

benefits.\nThe kiwi is a healthy choice of fruit and is rich with vitamins and antioxidants.\nThe vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants can provide essential health benefits.\nThe flesh is rich with vitamins that stimulate immunity and reduce the risk of disease.\nThe soluble dietary fiber found in kiwis can help stimulate regular and healthy digestion.\nKiwis can provide other health benefits like: Kiwi contains abundant amounts of Vitamin C, which stimulates the body\u2019s immune response.\nBy helping to maintain a healthy blood pressure and providing a boost of Vitamin C, the kiwifruit can reduce the risk of stroke \u00a0and heart disease.\nBeyond this, kiwi also contains a high level of dietary fiber.\nFiber can reduce risk factors for heart disease by lowering LDL or bad cholesterol.\nBoth in its tough skin and flesh, the kiwifruit contains high amounts of dietary fiber.\nWhen consumed with other healthy vitamin and mineral-rich fruits and vegetables, the high levels of antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids found in the kiwifruit may aid in preventing eye disease and promote overall ocular health.\nTo maintain this unique flavor and retain the kiwi\u2019s beneficial vitamin C content, kiwis are best served raw.","1":"That\u2019s because kiwi nutrition provides an insane amount of health benefits.\nKiwi\u2019s beneficial phytonutrients combined with the fantastic lineup of vitamins and minerals kiwi nutrition provides create a delicious, nutrient-dense fruit with an impressive list of health benefits.\nKiwi nutrition is super heart-healthy thanks to the high levels of potassium \u2014 which helps prevent low potassium\u00a0\u2014 fiber and vitamin K.\nKiwi nutrition\u00a0has elements that help with bone growth and maintenance, eye and vision health, and can even help you sleep better, among the following benefits.\nOne reason kiwifruit is undeniably a superfood is because it\u2019s a high-antioxidant food\u00a0that fights free radical damage.\nIn one study conducted by the Department of Chemical Toxicology, Division of Environmental Medicine at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, kiwifruit was supplemented to a normal diet and showed that with just one to two golden kiwifruit a day, a marked decrease in internal oxidative damage occurred.\n(1)\u00a0A big reason for this is that vitamin C levels in kiwifruit outshine oranges and provide benefits that help repair and maintain a number of body tissues and systems.\nAside from the high levels of vitamin C and E, both natural antioxidants, kiwifruit is also rich in polyphenols that have immunostimulatory activity, meaning they can prompt an immune system response.\n(3) According to research published in the Journal of Cellular Physiology, the polysaccharides in kiwifruit are\u00a0able to double collagen synthesis\u00a0in the body, compared to normal conditions when this activity reduces as we age.\n(4) Kiwi is also host to a carotenoid and antioxidant called lutein, which is incredibly beneficial to\u00a0skin health by protecting the skin from UV light, marking yet another kiwi nutrition benefit.\nKiwifruit and other fruits high in vitamin C content have been used successfully to treat a number of respiratory illnesses.\nTwo studies have shown beneficial reactions in both adults and children suffering from asthma and other respiratory illnesses and infections after adding kiwifruit to their diets.\nBoth studies concluded that the fruit was able to enhance the vitamin C concentration in the body, which was able to reduce the symptoms of the patients, including decreasing wheezing, head congestion and duration of sore throat.\n(5, 6) Kiwi nutrition\u2019s supply of lutein not only protects the skin, but is also a powerful phytochemical that can prevent many diseases of the eye, including age-related macular degeneration.\n(8) Along with lutein, kiwifruit has a great supply of another carotenoid, vitamin A, which is also largely beneficial to optimum eye health.\nA number of studies have shown kiwi helps reduce complications related to irritable bowel syndrome\u00a0as well as inflammatory bowel disease.\nThe findings of the studies suggest that adding kiwi\u00a0to patients\u2019 diets introduced\u00a0antioxidants and fiber, which were able produce anti-inflammatory results, as well as overall improvements in bowel function.\nOne kiwi\u00a0a day can provide a lower risk of stroke, blood clots and cardiovascular diseases.\nThe fiber found in kiwi is also very heart-healthy, along with vitamin K, which\u00a0is able to prevent the buildup of calcium in the arteries and therefore able to\u00a0reduce the risk for heart attacks.\nStudies have shown that people who regularly consume kiwifruit have 15 percent lowered triglyceride levels compared to those who do not.\n(12, 13) Kiwifruit is also a great source of omega-3s, magnesium, vitamin E and copper, all of which help keep the cardiovascular system working properly.\nStudies suggest that diets high in vitamin K can improve bone health and reduce the risk of bone-related injuries and diseases like osteoporosis.\n(14) Another kiwi nutrition benefit is its serotonin content.\nThe serotonin in kiwifruit\u00a0has been shown to increase sleep time and sleep efficiency by 13 percent and 5 percent, respectively, so if you can\u2019t sleep, kiwi may help.\n(16) Thanks to polysaccharide content and the abundance of antioxidants found in kiwi nutrition, studies in mice have shown anti-tumor and reduction of cancer cells.\nBoth green and golden kiwifruit have shown antifungal and antibacterial capabilities in several studies.\n(19) The golden kiwi fruit contains a protein called actinchinin, which is suggested as the origin of its antifungal capabilities.\nThese capabilities may also be connected to the large number of antioxidants in the fruit.\n(20) Both known for their high vitamin C content, kiwifruit and oranges are both great, healthy options to add to your diet.\nThere are only a few differences in\u00a0kiwi nutrition\u00a0benefits vs.\nSame goes for fruit salads, because the kiwi actually has the ability to tenderize itself as well.\n(22) Individuals on beta-blockers should consume kiwifruit in moderation, as the potassium found in the fruit can alter the potassium levels to higher than is healthy.","2":"Perfect on yogurt parfaits or in frozen fruit bars, it's a delicious addition to countless recipes.\nKiwi fruit is available fresh, frozen, or dried.\nRegardless of variety, check the ingredients list on frozen or dried options to ensure the product is only from the fruit and nothing else.\nAlthough traditional kiwi fruit has green flesh, there are a few different types of equally delicious kiwi fruit varieties available.\nBrondo says that they are known for having the highest vitamin C content of any other commonly eaten fruit (290% DV per serving).\nUnlike green kiwis, Brondo says that you can bite into a golden kiwi just as you would an apple.\nKiwi berries are another kiwi fruit variety that has been gaining popularity recently.\nBrondo suggests adding kiwi to infused water, tossing it in a smoothie, using it as a salad topping, or mixing slices into yogurt for a perfect pairing of probiotics and prebiotics.\nBrondo also shares that both green and gold kiwifruit contain a natural enzyme called actinidin that breaks down protein and makes a delicious marinade."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-kiwi","1":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/kiwi-nutrition\/","2":"www.goodhousekeeping.com\/health\/diet-nutrition\/a33606591\/kiwi-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
