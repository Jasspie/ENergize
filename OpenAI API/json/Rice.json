atmospheric greenhouse gas levels has been largely underestimated because reports on rice farming emissions leave out nitrous oxide.\nBut a new study conducted by researchers from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has shown just how much these farming and management strategies impact emissions.\nThe analysis shows that nitrous oxide and methane emissions from rice farms could have the same long-term warming impact as 600 coal plants and in the long term.\n\u201cThe full climate impact of rice farming has been significantly underestimated because up to this point, nitrous dioxide emissions from intermittently flooded farms have not been included,\u201d said K.\n\u201cIncreasing pressure on limited water resources under a changing climate could make additional rice-farming regions look to intermittent flooding to address water limitations and concerns about methane emissions.\u201d A major takeaway from the analysis is that nitrous oxide emissions need to monitored more closely and more accurately.\nWhile there have been studies on the climate impacts of rice farming before, these largely focused on methane emissions from continual flooding practices.\nThe team has called for closer monitoring of nitrous oxide emissions and say that scientists need to map flooding regimes, countries need to report nitrous oxide emissions, and rice farms have to reduce emissions by optimizing water, nitrogen, and organic matter use.\n\u201cIt is essential for scientists to measure both nitrous oxide and methane emissions from rice fields in order to develop policies effective at meeting food demand while mitigating rice farming\u2019s climate impacts,\u201d said Kritee.\n\u201cWe now know nitrous oxide emissions from rice farming can be large and impactful,\u201d said Richie Ahuja, a co-author of this study.\nMajor rice producing nations in Asia are investing to improve the agriculture sector and could benefit from the suggested dual mitigation strategies that lead to water savings, better yields, and less climate pollution.\u201d By Kay Vandette, Earth.com Staff Writer A new study from the University of Exeter reveals that...","1":"","2":"With water becoming increasingly scarce for agricultural uses, alternative ways to grow rice are being explored to farm this staple food more sustainably.\nMost rice farmers come from families that have made an occupation of cultivating this crop for many generations.\nDry rice farming is a particular form of cultivation that farmers have practiced for centuries.\nParticipating in economic and political decision-making is important for rice farmers to preserve the economic, social and political conditions that allow them to successfully pursue their farming livelihoods.\nDry rice cultivation is primarily a form of natural resource management.\nThe dry cultivation of rice involves agricultural practices to utilize and grow living things.\nAir and atmosphere, water, and land are all resources affected by this form of cultivation.\nThe availability of water is becoming scarce, leading to questions of how long the current rate of water usage can sustain current agricultural production levels.\nWays to cultivate rice without the large amounts of water needed are becoming more prevalent, but there are still downsides to many of these systems.\nMany of these water saving systems have lower crop yields, which is why many farmers are hesitant to switch to these processes.\nAlthough several of these methods can competitively produce yields comparable to those of the flooded rice fields, many farmers see no reason to change their ways while there is still water available.\nLowland farmers in particular have the greatest access to water, giving them no incentive to amend the way they have been farming for generations.\nAnother weakness is that many of the lowland farmers use cultivars of rice that would do very poorly in dry cultivation practices.\nWhile many upland rice cultivars are better suited to these water management methods, the problem of getting these cultivars of rice to the lowland farmers arises.\nThis method of rice cultivation is an ecological alternative to traditional flooding practices.\nOne of the most successful water-saving irrigation systems has used alternating between wetting and drying the fields.\nUsing pressurized technology, such as sprinklers is a water conserving technique that is already practiced in other agricultural industries in the world.\nSome of this technology can measure how wet or dry the soil is and automatically supply the fields with how ever much water is needed.\nOne of the most important resources needed for dry rice farming is cultivars of rice that are suited to grow in drier climates.\nThese water saving techniques will be unsuccessful if breeds of rice accustomed to flooded conditions are grown without the amounts of water needed.\nMany of these cultivars of rice that are adapted to growing with vast amounts of water are lowland breeds."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.earth.com\/news\/rice-farming-environmental-impact\/","1":"file.scirp.org\/pdf\/AJPS_2015082514031710.pdf","2":"goodmenproject.com\/environment-2\/the-environmental-impact-of-dry-rice-cultivation\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Brown and white rice are the same grain, just milled differently.\nKernels of brown rice have the bran layer intact.\nThe presence of the bran layer makes brown rice more nutritious than white, although some white rice is fortified.\nThe bran layer also makes brown rice take longer to cook.\nYou'll get health benefits like : Brown rice can help people with diabetes control their blood sugar.\nWith a glycemic index of 64, white rice is more likely to spike blood sugar than brown rice, with a glycemic index of 55.\nWhole grains like brown rice contain more fiber than processed foods.\nBrown rice contains three distinct types of phenolics, which are antioxidants that occur naturally in plants.\nPhenolics occur in the bran layer of rice and in the germ, the reproductive part of a grain.\nWhen the bran is removed to make white rice, many of the phenolics are lost.\nThe insoluble fiber in brown rice promotes regular bowel movements.\nBecause it is gluten-free, brown rice is a good food choice for people with celiac disease.\nWhite rice has about the same calorie count as brown but only one-third of the fiber and slightly less protein.\nThe second hazard associated with rice is arsenic (a highly toxic chemical) in the grain.\nYou can reduce the arsenic in rice by rinsing it and cooking it with extra water.","1":"White rice has had the fibre-rich outer bran of the grain removed along-with the nutrient-rich germ.\nBrown rice, on the other hand, contains both the bran and germ, making it nutrient- and fibre-rich and retains a nutty flavour.\nBrown rice contains fibre and protein, both known to have a satiating effect and contributing to a lower glycaemic index (GI) than that of white rice.\nFor this reason, opting for brown rice over white helps reduce blood glucose and fasting insulin levels.\nHowever, it is thought that a substantial serving of white rice, eaten on a regular basis, may lead to elevations in blood sugar levels, which over time may increase your risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain.\nBrown rice retains the bran layer and as such contains protective compounds called flavonoids, examples of these include apigenin and quercetin.\nNumerous studies suggest including wholegrains, like brown rice, in the diet is linked to a reduced risk of conditions like heart disease, some cancers including pancreatic and gastric cancers as well as type 2 diabetes.\nWhite rice is easily digested, low in fibre and when cooked and served correctly is unlikely to cause gastric upset.\nThe brown, wholegrain variety is especially useful because it supplies insoluble fibre, which promotes digestive function and \u2018fuels\u2019 the beneficial gut bacteria which are so important for health.\nRice is an important dietary staple however, reports have linked it with arsenic contamination, high levels of which, over a consistent period, have been linked with an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.\nThe accumulation of arsenic tends to be greatest in the bran part of the grain, which means wholegrain rice may potentially have higher amounts of this heavy metal contaminant than white rice.\nThis risk is increased by their limited dietary choices and the fact that many first foods are rice-based.","2":"Most notably, brown rice is a whole grain while white rice is a refined grain and a processed food.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for 1 cup (186g) of cooked, enriched, short-grain white rice.1\ufeff There are over 53 grams of carbohydrate in a single serving of white rice.\nThe glycemic index of white rice is estimated to be 73.\nThe glycemic index of brown rice, on the other hand, is estimated to be about 68.\nShort-grain rice tends to have a higher glycemic index than long-grain, medium-grain, and brown rice.\nBrown rice has significantly more fiber than white rice (about 3 grams per cup of cooked brown rice) because it is a whole grain.\nBrown rice also has fewer carbohydrates than white rice at 49.6g per cup.2\ufeff All rice is originally whole-grain, with the bran attached.\nWhite rice is produced by pearling, which is a process through which the grain passes through a machine where it is rolled and the bran is gently \"pearled\" off, leaving the white kernel intact.\nPearling also lowers the cooking time and extends the shelf life of grains.\nThere is almost no fat in rice, as long as you cook it without adding any oil or butter.\nThere are over 4 grams of protein in a 1-cup serving of white rice, and about 5 grams in the same size serving of brown rice.\nBrown rice\u00a0provides more vitamins than white rice.3\ufeff In addition to thiamin and magnesium, brown rice contains selenium, which influences thyroid function and is important in antioxidant processes.\nRice can be part of a balanced diet, particularly if you choose the unprocessed, brown rice varieties.\nMany of the health benefits of rice come from the vitamins and minerals that it provides.\nRice contains resistant starch, which can lead to the formation of certain fatty acids that help the colon stay healthy.\nThese fatty acids may also decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.4\ufeff Consuming whole grains, including brown rice, is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.5\ufeff The American Heart Association recommends making sure that at least half of the grains you eat are whole grains\u2014so, aim to choose brown rice over white and 100% whole wheat bread over white bread most of the time.\nRice is a naturally\u00a0gluten-free grain\u00a0so it is useful to people with celiac disease and non-celiac sensitivity.\nAthletes who need a lot of energy in the form of carbohydrates can get it from white rice.\nMany prefer white rice over brown for its high-carb, low-fiber profile.6\ufeff Although rice allergy is uncommon, it is possible.\nPeople with a rice allergy may also be sensitive to corn, soy, and barley, or vice versa.7\ufeff Rice is one of the most common triggers for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES).\nConverted rice retains more nutrients and cooks a little faster than regular milled white rice.\nEnriched rice has vitamins and minerals added back after it is refined.\nThis process removes some of the nutrients and flavor\u00a0but makes for a very quick-cooking rice product.3\ufeff Once rice is cooked, store it in the refrigerator and use it within\u00a0three to four days.\nStore uncooked white rice in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.\nBrown rice will keep in a cool, dry place for about six months, but will last about one year in the freezer.\nChoose brown rice when possible, since it is a whole grain.\nSome people rinse rice before cooking.\nRice, white, short-grain, enriched, cooked.\nRice, brown, cooked.\nProcessing conditions, rice properties, health and
