Now We Know : The Salt : NPR"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"Researchers were shocked to discover what part of the bread-making process generates most emissions.\nThat is why researchers at the University of Sheffield in England thought that measuring the carbon footprint of bread would be an effective and interesting exercise.\nNobody really talks about it (except in the context of Wheat Belly), but it\u2019s a perfect example of what study author Dr. Liam Goucher describes as a \u201creal-world supply chain.\u201d Published earlier this week in Nature Plants journal, the study focused on every aspect of a loaf of bread\u2019s life cycle, from growing, harvesting, and transporting grain to be milled, to producing flour, shipping to a bakery, baking loaves and packaging them.\nIn their life cycle analysis, the researchers found that a loaf of bread emits about a half-kilo of carbon dioxide.\nForty-three percent of bread\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the fertilizers used to grow wheat.","1":"A new study published Monday in Nature Plants, a journal,\u00a0analyses the environmental cost of producing a loaf of bread.\nResults show that the use of fertiliser to grow wheat, which itself makes up 43% of all greenhouse emissions, is the main culprit in the weight of bread\u2019s carbon footprint.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield, in the UK aimed to understand the environmental impacts\u00a0of bread entire life cycle and stated that their choice of bread was because it employed a\u00a0\u201creal-world supply chain,\u201d says Liam Goucher, the lead author of the study and a research fellow at the Grantham Center for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield.\n\u201cWe focused on a specific farm, which was in Lincoln, in the UK, and we focused on a specific mill and a specific [commercial] bakery.\u201d The researchers firstly collected and analysed data for emissions involved at each step of the process.\n\u201cWe found that over half of the environmental impacts of producing a loaf of bread come from wheat cultivation,\u201d says Goucher.\nSynthetic fertilisers are considered to boost the growth of plants as well as raise yields, their environmental impact is apparent.","2":"hide caption From field to bakery, a loaf of bread packs a measurable environmental punch.\nA new study published Monday in Nature Plants breaks down the environmental cost of producing a loaf of bread, from wheat field to bakery.\nThey chose bread and used a \"real-world supply chain,\" says Liam Goucher, the lead author of the study and a research fellow at the Grantham Center for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield.\n\"We focused on a specific farm, which was in Lincoln, in the U.K., and we focused on a specific mill and a specific [commercial] bakery.\" They collected and analyzed data for emissions involved at every step of the process, including growing the wheat, fertilizing it, harvesting the crop, transporting the grains to the mill, grinding the grains into flour, transporting the flour to a bakery and then baking and packaging a loaf of bread.\n\"We found that over half of the environmental impacts of producing a loaf of bread come from wheat cultivation,\" says Goucher.\nA farmer sprays a chemical fertilizer containing nitrogen on a wheat field in southern France.\nhide caption A farmer sprays a chemical fertilizer containing nitrogen on a wheat field in southern France.\nAnd we also know about the emissions involved in manufacturing fertilizers (an energy-intensive process) and their use on farms.\n\"It kind of points to the fact that if you want to reduce the climate impact of food production, we need to think of fertilizer manufacturing and fertilizer application as one place where we have big leverage to reduce climate impact,\" says Navin Ramankutty, a professor at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, who was not involved in the study.\nThere are known ways to reduce use of nitrogen fertilizers, like applying fertilizers only at certain times of the growing season, when plants need them the most.\n\"This is exactly the kind of thing that should be done with other food commodities.\" Galloway says it would be even more useful to do such analysis on animal products like beef and pork, which we know are bigger sources of greenhouse gas emissions."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.treehugger.com\/whats-environmental-impact-loaf-bread-4858589","1":"www.newfoodmagazine.com\/news\/34331\/environment-bread-farm-fork\/","2":"www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2017\/02\/27\/517531611\/whats-the-environmental-footprint-of-a-loaf-of-bread-now-we-know"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 10","1":" 10","2":" 10"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"Five Health Benefits of Eating Bread -

Fuel for longer: Whole grains and legumes contain complex carbohydrates[8].\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic[9], complex carbohydrates stimulate serotonin production and if you eliminate them entirely from your diet you can become really cranky.\nDoctor Amy Jamieson-Petonic[10], registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic,recommends eating every three to four hours and including complex carbs each time (to feel energized and happy).\n4. Folic acid boost: Fortification is a safe practice where essential vitamins and minerals are added to staple foods such as bread and wheat flour.\nParticularly, in the United States mandatory folic acid fortification of cereal grain products such as refined wheat flour has been established to reduce a woman\u00b4s risk of having a baby affected by Spina bifida or other neural tube birth defects.[11]It is estimated that this measure has saved more than 1,300 from neural tube birth defects on a yearly basis.[12] 5.\nFight cancer: The American Institute for Cancer Research[13]includes whole wheat bread and whole grains within the AICR\u00b4s Foods that Fight Cancer[14]list published on their site.\nAfter years of study they\u00b4ve found that dietary fiber and phytochemicals in whole grains hold anti-cancer properties.","1":"White bread is fortified with calcium and four medium slices per day would provide over 30% of the recommended daily intake of calcium which we need every day to maintain healthy bones and teeth.\nBread, especially wholemeal, is an important source of dietary fibre which helps to keep our digestive system healthy, helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels and makes us feel fuller for longer.\nAn average medium slice of white bread contains 77 calories, brown contains 72 calories and wholemeal contains 79 calories.\nAn average medium slice of white bread contains 0.6g of fat, brown bread contains 0.7g and wholemeal contains 0.9g.\nMost breads are low in sugar which is important for healthy teeth and maintaining a healthy weight.","2":"Recent\u00a0research\u00a0from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found people who ate 70g (about four servings) of whole grains per day, compared with those who ate little or no whole grains, had a 22% lower risk of premature death, a 23% lower risk of death from heart disease, and a 20% lower risk of death from cancer.\nOne-hundred percent whole grain and whole wheat bread varieties are typically regarded as the best, but other types have their benefits, too.\nIf you are grain-sensitive or have celiac disease, we\u2019ve got you covered with gluten-free options as well.\nEzekiel bread stands out among most varieties because it\u2019s made without added sugar and from sprouted whole grains.\nThe sprouting process increases the amount and bio-availability of vitamins, like vitamin C, and minerals, like folate and lysine, so Ezekiel bread is a bonafide nutritional powerhouse.\nThe sprouted grain can be stored until it\u2019s cooked or milled into sprouted grain flour, and then make bread.\nWet sprouting process: You can also mash wet, sprouted grains into a thick paste to make breads, tortillas, and more; these products are often described as \u201cflourless.\u201d Ezekiel bread is an amazing choice for vegetarians, because it\u2019s made from wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt.\nWhat\u2019s more, sprouted grains are more easily tolerated by people with grain protein sensitivities, may help fight diabetes, protect against fatty liver disease, and reduce your risk for cardiovascular issues.\nWe like Food for Life Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Bread.\nResearch shows flax seed and flaxbread can reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes to boot.\nWe like\u00a0Alvarado St. Bakery Essential Flaxseed Bread, made from sprouted organic whole flax seeds and wheat berries.\nRye bread is made with rye flour, which comes from a wheat-like plant.\nIt\u2019s thanks to their high source of cholesterol-lowering fiber called beta-glucan, which has also been shown to reduce certain cancers, like colon cancer, diabetes, digestive problems, and heart disease.\nSince 1941, the U.S. has required manufacturers to enrich wheat flour with vitamins B1, B2, B3, and iron because processing takes about 60% of the nutrients out, according to The University of Chicago Press.\nBut even then, the same value of B vitamins and iron that\u2019s taken out isn\u2019t put back in, which is why you want to choose 100% whole wheat bread."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"grainfoodsfoundation.org\/articles\/grains-101-articles\/five-health-benefits-of-eating-bread\/","1":"www.fob.uk.com\/nutrition-and-health\/","2":"www.mensjournal.com\/food-drink\/healthiest-types-bread-and-their-health-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":" 50","2":" 70"}}
