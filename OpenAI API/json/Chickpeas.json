market data, chickpeas have a relatively low carbon footprintDestruction: low, chickpea production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nYes, chickpeas are vegan.\nChickpeas are a legume and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day

knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"A $4 million research project in Ethiopia will improve the genetic diversity of chickpea varieties.\nA new research effort, designed to\u00a0improve the productivity of chickpea varieties by harnessing the genetic diversity of wild species, was launched in Ethiopia through the federal Feed the Future Initiative and under the leadership of the University of California, Davis.\nThe new, five-year, $4 million research program is especially important in the developing world, where the chickpea provides a crucial source of income, food security and nutrition to poor farmers \u2014 particularly women.\n\u201cThis project aims to develop the chickpea for increased resilience to climate stress and other high-value traits by expanding the range of genetic adaptations available to breeders,\u201d said\u00a0Doug Cook, a UC Davis professor of\u00a0plant pathology\u00a0and director of the project.\nThrough this project, known as the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Climate Resilient Chickpea, the researchers will combine advanced genomic technologies with analysis of plant traits to identify new and desirable genes harbored by chickpea\u2019s closest wild relatives.\nThe UC Davis team has expertise in molecular biology and genomics and, together with partners, will drive efforts to understand the molecular-genetic basis of agronomic traits, ultimately delivering the corresponding genes through breeding into improved chickpea varieties.\nThe project provides a key opportunity to engage Ethiopian scientists and farmers in a global research effort to improve chickpea productivity.","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"healabel.com\/c-ingredients\/chickpeas","1":"caes.ucdavis.edu\/news\/articles\/2014\/02\/chickpea-project-boost-nutrition-and-environmental-sustainability","2":"grdc.com.au\/__data\/assets\/pdf_file\/0024\/369420\/GrowNote-Chickpea-North-14-Environment.pdf"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

nutritional information"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"As a rich source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, chickpeas may offer a variety of health benefits, such as improving digestion, aiding weight management and reducing the risk of several diseases.\nAdditionally, chickpeas are high in protein and make an excellent replacement for meat in vegetarian and vegan diets.\nThe protein and fiber in chickpeas may help keep your appetite under control.\nIn fact, the filling effects of the protein and fiber in chickpeas may automatically lower your calorie intake throughout the day and at meals (4Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nChickpeas are high in protein and fiber, which makes them a filling food that may help lower appetite and reduce calorie intake at meals.\nChickpeas are a great source of plant-based protein, making them an appropriate food choice for those who do not eat animal products.\nThe protein in chickpeas may help promote fullness and keep your appetite under control.\nChickpeas are an excellent source of protein, which has a variety of health benefits, ranging from weight management to bone health.\nFurthermore, the protein and fiber in chickpeas may promote weight management due to their appetite-lowering effects and potential to help reduce calorie intake at meals (8Trusted Source).\nIn one study, those who ate chickpeas regularly were 53% less likely to be obese and had a lower body mass index and weight circumference, compared to those who did not eat chickpeas (16Trusted Source).\nChickpeas contain a moderate amount of calories and are high in fiber and protein, all properties that play a role in weight management.\nChickpeas have several properties that may help manage your blood sugar levels.\nDiets including many low-GI foods have been shown to promote blood sugar management (16Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nSecond, chickpeas are a good source of fiber and protein, which are both known for their role in blood sugar regulation.\nAlso, eating protein-rich foods may help maintain healthy blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes (5Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nIn one study, 19 people who ate a meal that contained 200 grams of chickpeas had a 21% reduction in blood sugar levels, compared to when they ate a meal that contained whole-grain cereal or white bread (20Trusted Source).\nAnother 12-week study found that 45 individuals who ate 728 grams of chickpeas per week had a notable reduction in their fasting insulin levels, which is an important factor in blood sugar control (21Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, several studies have associated chickpea consumption with a reduced risk of several diseases, including diabetes and heart disease.\nChickpeas have a low GI and are also a great source of fiber and protein, all properties that support healthy blood sugar control.\nChickpeas are full of fiber, which has several proven benefits for digestive health (16Trusted Source).\nChickpeas are a great source of several minerals, such as magnesium and potassium, which have been studied for their potential to boost heart health (1, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, the soluble fiber in chickpeas has been shown to help reduce triglyceride and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol levels, which may increase heart disease risk when elevated (16Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nIn one 12- week study, 45 people who ate 728 grams of chickpeas per week significantly reduced their total cholesterol levels by an average of almost 16 mg\/dL (21Trusted Source).\nIncluding chickpeas in your diet on a regular basis may help reduce your risk of certain types of cancer.\nFirst, eating chickpeas may promote the body\u2019s production of butyrate, a fatty acid that has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation in colon cells, possibly decreasing the risk of colon cancer (16, 25Trusted Source).\nChickpeas have a few properties known to support blood sugar control, and thus may help prevent and manage diabetes.\nThe fiber and protein in chickpeas help prevent your blood sugar levels from rising too quickly after eating, which is an important factor in diabetes management (5Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nChickpeas have many characteristics that may help prevent some chronic illnesses, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes.\nIncluding chickpeas in your diet regularly will support your health and may reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.\nFurthermore, chickpeas are delicious and certainly worth including in your diet if you want to reap their health benefits.\nStudies show that fiber has various health benefits, including weight loss and improved digestive\u2026 Calorie density is the amount of calories per volume of food.\nChoosing foods with a low calorie density can help you lose weight while eating more\u2026 Protein is an important nutrient for optimal health, but not all protein sources are equal.","1":"Chickpeas, also called\u00a0garbanzo beans, are one of the oldest consumed crops in the world.\nIn fact, they have been a part of certain traditional diets for over 7,500 years, and it\u2019s not hard to see why when you take into account the benefits of chickpeas nutrition.\nToday, chickpeas remain one of the most popular legumes across nearly every continent, and again, it\u2019s not surprising why when we look at the benefits of chickpeas nutrition.\nChickpeas are a type of legume that offer a range of health benefits.\nChickpeas, or garbanzo beans, are a great source of plant-based protein along with fiber, iron, zinc, phosphorus, B vitamins and more.\nBeans, pulses and legumes are nutrient-dense foods and unique in that they provide a combination of protein, starch, fiber and minerals.\nYes, because the starch found in chickpeas is digested slowly and supports more stabilized blood sugar levels (more on this below).\nWith so many vitamins and nutrients, chickpeas benefit the body in a number of different ways.\nHere are the top eight benefits of chickpeas: Chickpeas, like all legumes, are a form of complex carbohydrate that the body is able to slowly digest and use for energy.\nEven very low-carb diets require you to get at least 25 grams of carbs per day, and a small serving of chickpeas can help to provide some of these carbohydrates.\nIn most cases, yes, because they are considered a \u201cslow carb.\u201d Chickpeas nutrition includes starch, which is a slow-burning carbohydrate that the body does not react to by suddenly spiking glucose in the blood.\nUnlike simple sugars \u2014 found in processed products like refined flour, white bread, pasta, soda, candy and most other packaged foods \u2014 the starches found in chickpeas\u00a0take an extended period of time\u00a0to break down once consumed.\nStarches contain natural sugars called glucose, which the body uses easily for many essential functions, but glucose can be troublesome for people who are prediabetic or who have\u00a0diabetes.\nThe process of digesting and utilizing the glucose found in all beans and starches is drawn-out, which is extremely important for diabetics, who have trouble reaching a stable blood sugar level after contain sugars due to a resistance to insulin.\n(3) Chickpeas\u00a0are high in both protein and fiber, which helps make you feel full, curb food cravings and hopefully reduce unhealthy snacking.\n(4) Beans make a filling addition to any recipe because of their fiber, complex carbs and protein.\nChickpeas nutrition has macronutrients that work together to give us a feeling of being full after eating, while also helping control our blood sugar levels and therefore maintaining our energy.\nFrequently consuming foods like\u00a0fat-burning\u00a0garbanzo beans is an excellent way to aid in healthy and sustainable\u00a0weight loss.\nBecause they are so low in calories but high in essential fiber and protein, they are a perfect food for those that need to lose some weight but who are watching calorie intake.\nA major benefit of chickpeas nutrition is helping reduce constipation.\nFiber also helps\u00a0balance pH levels\u00a0and bacteria within the gut, increasing healthy bacteria while also decreasing unhealthy bacteria.\nThe high amount of fiber in garbanzo beans is responsible for its filling effect and helps improve digestion, but it does much more than this.\nFiber\u00a0aids in heart health, helps control blood sugar levels, and guards against cancer, heart disease, diverticulosis, kidney stones, PMS, obesity and more.\nCardiologists\u2019 favorite benefit of chickpeas nutrition is that it supports heart health in a number of ways.\nChickpeas\u00a0have been shown to help balance unhealthy cholesterol levels, reduce hypertension and protect against heart disease in multiple ways.\nThis may be partially due to the high amount of\u00a0fiber\u00a0found in chickpeas nutrition, which helps people avoid overeating and gaining harmful excess weight, especially around the vital organs.\n(6) Fiber works to\u00a0create a gel-like substance in the digestive system that binds with fatty acids, helping balance\u00a0cholesterol levels.\nIn fact, studies show that having just one daily serving (about 3\/4 cup cooked) of beans of any kind can help decrease chances of a heart attack and help balance \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\nConsuming beans has also been shown in animal studies to have protective benefits against cancer, in particular colon cancer, due to their high fiber content.\n(9) Because beans keep the digestive system, including the colon, free from harmful bacteria and toxic buildup, they create a healthier overall environment where\u00a0pH levels\u00a0are balanced,\u00a0inflammation\u00a0is reduced and therefore\u00a0cancer\u00a0cells cannot proliferate like they can in an unhealthy environment.\nChickpeas nutrition boasts high levels of iron, zinc, folate, phosphorus and B vitamins, all of which are especially important for vegetarians and vegans who may be lacking in these essential nutrients due to avoiding animal products.\nIt also helps the body utilize other B Vitamins in addition to protein (in the form of amino acids).\nLegumes have an alkalizing effect on the body, which helps balance pH levels by combating the high level of acidity that is common in most modern, western diets.\nWhen chickpeas are combined with a source of healthy fat, like olive oil \u2014 which is the case with hummus \u2014 nutrient absorption is further increased.\nAdditionally, chickpeas are a good source of three nutrients that help to reduce common symptoms associated with PMS: magnesium, manganese and vitamin B6.\nProtein\u00a0is an essential macronutrient that plays an important role in nearly every function in the body, including our vital organs, muscles, tissues and even hormone levels.\nChickpeas nutrition not only contains important protein, about 15 grams per cup of cooked beans, but also has many other nutrients and fiber too.\nChickpeas are often eaten with grains or vegetables, for example in stews or in hummus that is eaten with pita bread; these foods luckily work together to make up a \u201ccomplete protein.\u201d This means they contain all of the building blocks of protein, called essential amino acids, that are necessary for the body to acquire from food in order to use for body function and energy.\nChickpeas and garbanzo beans\u00a0are the same things (from the same plant family) \u2014 they are just two different ways of describing the same legume.\nMany people feel that beans made from scratch- meaning from dried form- taste the best and hold their texture more so than precooked kinds.\nThe good news is that precooked beans, either in canned or frozen form, often have the same nutrient levels as freshly made beans, so as long as you buy a high-quality kind, you can conveniently enjoy beans even when you\u2019re in a pinch.\nLook for dried chickpeas\u00a0in the \u201cbulk bin\u201d section of your favorite health food store, where you will likely be able to find organic dried beans for sale at a very low cost.\nIt\u2019s best to soak all dried beans overnight prior to cooking them, which helps make them more digestible, aids in absorption of their nutrients and decreases cooking time.\nSoaking and sprouting beans helps eliminate phytic acid and may greatly increase mineral absorption in addition to making the beans more digestible and less gas-forming.\nIn order to avoid consuming too high of levels of phytic acid, it\u2019s best to buy organic beans that are also labeled GMO free, since phytic acid is much higher in foods grown using modern high-phosphate fertilizers than those grown in natural compost.\nAlso try soaking and sprouting your beans (and grains too) since this can help to reduce phytic acid by around 50\u2013100 percent.\nIt\u2019s believed that garbanzo beans were first consumed by Ancient Mediterranean populations between 7500\u201310,000 years ago and then spread to southern France and Germany shortly after.\nIt\u2019s believed that centuries ago populations associated chickpeas with the philosophical god Venus because the beans were believed to offer powerful health benefits related to reproduction.\nPeople across the U.S. now commonly consume chickpeas\u00a0due to their many culinary uses and noted health benefits.\nBeans\/legumes can increase gas and bloating due to their high fiber content and also because of the types of carbohydrates they contain.\nI recommend eating small servings and also soaking beans before cooking them to help improve digestion.","2":"Chickpeas contain a range of nutrients, including protein, which is necessary for bone, muscle, and skin health.\nThe nutrients in chickpeas may also help prevent a number of health conditions.\nOne cup of chickpeas, weighing 164 grams (g), provides 12.5 gTrusted Source of fiber.\nFiber may benefit people with diabetes, and the American Diabetes Association recommend chickpeas as a source of dietary fiber.\nA 2014 studyTrusted Source concluded that eating at least 30 g of fiber per day could help reduce inflammation in people with type 1 diabetes.\nA 2018 reviewTrusted Source of meta-analyses found that a high fiber diet may help lower blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for AmericansTrusted Source recommend that adults consume 25.2\u201328.0 g of fiber a day, depending on age and sex.\nChickpeas can play a role in a healthful diabetes meal plan.\nTo prevent high blood pressure, experts recommend limiting the intake of added sodium, or salt, and increasing the intake of potassium.\nCurrent guidelinesTrusted Source recommend that adults consume at least 4,700 milligrams (mg) of potassium per day.\nA cup of chickpeas, weighing 164 g, provides 474 mgTrusted Source of potassium.\nThe fiber, potassium, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and selenium in chickpeas all support heart health.\nFiber helps decrease the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels in the blood.\nAntioxidants help the body remove free radicals, and the selenium and beta carotene in chickpeas act as antioxidants.\nA cup of chickpeas contains 6.1 microgramsTrusted Source (mcg) of selenium.\nThe Office of Dietary SupplementsTrusted Source (ODS) recommend that adults consume 55 mcg of selenium a day.\nIn addition, there is evidenceTrusted Source that fiber, which chickpeas contain, can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.\nA cup of chickpeas contains 69.7 mg of choline, which helps with brain and nervous system function.\nThe ODS recommend that adults consume 400\u2013550 mgTrusted Source of choline a day, depending on sex and whether they are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nSome researchTrusted Source suggests that a selenium deficiency may increase the risk of cognitive decline in older people.\nA cup of chickpeas contains 4.7 mgTrusted Source of iron, or between a half and one-fifthTrusted Source of a person\u2019s daily requirement, depending on the individual.\nIt also provides some vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron.\nHere, find some dietary tips and meal plans to help deal with iron deficiency.\nIt also shows how much of each nutrient a person should consume each day, according to the Dietary Guidelines for AmericanTrusted Sources.\nFor people following a vegan or vegetarian diet, chickpeas are an excellent choice, as they provide protein, iron, selenium, and B vitamins.\nPeople should not eat raw chickpeas or other raw pulses, as they contain toxins and substances that are difficult to digest.\nPotassium can help manage blood pressure, but too much can be harmful for the kidneys.\nPeople who use beta-blockers should consume high potassium foods, such as chickpeas, in moderation.\nMaking a grocery list can help people plan and budget, buy nutritious foods, and improve their overall health."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/chickpeas-nutrition-benefits","1":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/chickpeas-nutrition\/","2":"www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/280244"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
