resources, human resources, and incorporate innovation and the newest technologies to produce the world\u2019s finest pistachios.\nPistachios are considered a key element of the Mediterranean Diet, a diet inspired by the eating habits of the peoples of Greece, Southern Italy, and Spain that incorporates the key ingredients of healthy eating --- fish, olive oil, whole grains, and plant-based foods like legumes, fruits, nuts, and vegetables.\nConsuming pistachios and other nuts may boost \u201cgood\u201d HDL-cholesterol levels in the blood and reduce the risks of stroke.i Current findings indicate that patients who consumed pistachios had improved heart health, reduced risk of breast cancer, and lowered the incidence of gestational diabetes.ii Pistachios are a plant-based protein and they are a valuable source of energy to fuel active bodies.\nNumerous health studies suggest that adding pistachios to the diet increases nutrient uptake and does not contribute to an increased weight, waist circumference or body mass index.iv Eating pistachios may preserve skin health due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles played by carotenoids, flavonoids and tocopherols in pistachios, which may play a role in the promotion of skin health and protection against photodamage.v The story about the sustainability of American-grown pistachios and their benefit to our environment is a powerful one.\nMaybe it\u2019s because the pistachio industry is relatively new in the United States, with commercial production beginning as recently as the 1970\u2019s, that they are quick to adopt new technologies and practices that result in continuous improvement.\nAmerican pistachio growers are constantly investing in research and innovation to develop the best practices in the utilization of renewable energy and overall farming efficiency.\nAmerican pistachio growers will never rest in their quest to invent, invest and adopt new technologies that make their operations more sustainable.\nThe American pistachio community is at the forefront of efforts to promote a sustainable environment and to conserve our precious water and soils.\nThe pistachio tree is, by nature, a drought-resistant plant that originated in the middle east, but precise applications of water at particular times in its growth cycle are critical to produce perfect pistachios.\nGrowers work closely with university researchers, irrigation specialists, and University of California Cooperative Extension farm advisors to adopt the most progressive water management technology and irrigation programs in the world.\nWater used on pistachio farms is often recycled, not only for plant operations and tree nutrition, but to support wildlife and diverse habitat on farms and lands adjacent to pistachio orchards.\nPublic Policy Institute of CaliforniaCalifornia pistachio growers and producers of other fruit and nut crops have dramatically increased yields while reducing water consumption.\nThe development of new apps has allowed growers to use their smart devices to monitor in real time the movement of water through the soil to ensure that it reaches and stays where it\u2019s needed in the root zone.\nGrowers today have a wealth of data at their disposal\u2014weather and climatic information to help them devise efficient irrigation schedules, and satellite imaging to help them identify areas of an orchard that may be deficient in water and crop nutrients, or where those precious inputs are being over-applied.\nToday, micro-nutrient fertilizer is carefully metered to pistachio trees through drip irrigation systems to ensure they are applied when and where trees need them most for optimal production.\nToday, the workforce in California, Arizona and New Mexico has grown right along with the surge in newly planted orchards.\nPistachio farms and processing facilities abide by the strictest workplace standards and rules in the nation to ensure their employees have a safe, secure and productive work environment.\nThey\u2019re part of our family.\u201d Scores of laborers who came to the U.S. on a work visa earned their U.S. citizenship with the help of their employers and became valued contributors in their communities, buying homes, having children and having a rewarding career in the pistachio industry.\nFederal law in the United States sets minimum social and economic rights for workers, but the pistachio-producing states of Arizona and New Mexico go beyond those minimums, with California exceeding the federal minimum wage by more than 60 percent.","1":"Proceed to uest.ntua.gr (unsafe)","2":"But did you know nuts \u2013 yes, as in almonds, pistachios, walnuts, etc.\nIn fact right now, almond farms in the Murray-Darling Basin are struggling with water supply.\nMany farmers are worried there won\u2019t be enough water to go around, and it\u2019s in part because almond trees use up too much of it compared to other crops.\nLast year, a Canadian pension fund bought up $490 million in water rights in the Murray-Darling to water almond trees.\nWhile some are locally grown or imported from the Middle East, chances are, when you\u2019re buying nuts at the supermarket, they\u2019re from the Golden State.\nCalifornia actually produces nuts for the whole world, despite being a dry state which spent most of the last decade enduring its worst drought in 1,200 years.\nAlmond farms account for 10% of the state\u2019s water use \u2013 more than any individual city.\nThere\u2019s even a single pistachio farm which uses more water than the whole of LA.\nMeanwhile, an upcoming documentary, Pistachio Wars, explores the pistachio industry\u2019s push for a war with Iran, but again, it also looks at how much the Californian nut farms disregard environmental stewardship responsibilities.\nHere\u2019s what we can to do be more conscious nut consumers: Peanuts and cashews \u2013 two nuts which technically aren\u2019t nuts \u2013 are much easier on the environment than almonds or pistachios.\nThey don\u2019t need a tonne of water or pesticides, and can be grown in really poor soil where other crops won\u2019t grow.\nBuying nuts grown anywhere other than California is a step in the right direction.\nWhile there are some issues with almonds grown in the Murray-Darling basin, in general, Aussie-grown nuts won\u2019t be as terrible for the environment.\nBecause they\u2019re being grown in their natural environment, they don\u2019t need an ungodly (and unseasonable) amount of water to thrive.\nIt\u2019s important to be conscious of what and how much we consume, and going easy on the nuts surely won\u2019t be the end of the world."},"environment_urls":{"0":"americanpistachios.org\/growing-and-harvesting\/sustainability","1":"uest.ntua.gr\/cyprus2016\/proceedings\/presentation\/15.komnitsas_footprint_cyprus16_final.pdf","2":"www.pedestrian.tv\/bites\/nuts-bad-for-environment-almonds-pistachios\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

seeds of the Pistacia vera tree contain healthy fats and are a good source of protein, fiber, and antioxidants.\nWhat\u2019s more, they contain several essential nutrients and can aid weight loss and heart and gut health.\nAmong nuts, pistachios have the highest content of lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which are very important antioxidants for eye health (6Trusted Source, 7).\nWhile eating nuts has many health benefits, they\u2019re typically high in calories.\nThey also have a higher ratio of essential amino acids \u2060\u2014 the building blocks of protein \u2060\u2014 than any other nut (10Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s converted into nitric oxide in your body, which is a compound that causes your blood vessels to dilate, aiding blood flow (6Trusted Source).\nPistachios are rich in fiber and protein, both of which increase feelings of fullness and help you eat less (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nIn one 12-week weight loss program, those who ate 1.9 ounces (53 grams) of pistachios per day as an afternoon snack had twice the reduction in body mass index, compared with those who ate 2 ounces (56 grams) of pretzels per day (16Trusted Source).\nMoreover, another 24-week study in individuals with excess weight showed that those who consumed 20% of calories from pistachios lost 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) more from their waistlines than those who did not eat pistachios (17Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that individuals who ate in-shell pistachios consumed 41% fewer calories than individuals who ate shelled pistachios (21Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Pistachios are high in fiber, with one serving containing 3 grams (2Trusted Source).\nGut bacteria then ferment the fiber and convert it into short-chain fatty acids, which may have several health benefits, including a reduced risk of developing digestive disorders, cancer, and heart disease (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nIn addition to being high in antioxidants, pistachios may lower blood cholesterol and improve blood pressure, thus lowering your risk of heart disease (6Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nUp to 67% of these studies have shown reductions in total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and increases in HDL (good) cholesterol (28Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, none of these studies observed that eating pistachios harmed the blood lipid profile (28Trusted Source).\nOne 4-week study in people with high LDL cholesterol had participants consume 10% of their daily calories from pistachios.\nWhat\u2019s more, a diet consisting of 20% of calories from pistachios lowered LDL cholesterol by 12% (25Trusted Source).\nA review of 21 studies found that eating pistachios reduced the upper limit of blood pressure by 1.82 mm\/Hg and the lower limit by 0.8 mm\/Hg (29Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s important that it works properly, as endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor for heart disease (30Trusted Source).\nIt causes blood vessels to dilate by signaling the smooth cells in the endothelium to relax (30Trusted Source).\nTherefore, these tiny nuts may play an important role in promoting blood vessel health.\nOne study in 42 patients who consumed 1.5 ounces (40 grams) of pistachios a day for 3 months showed improvements in markers of endothelial function and vascular stiffness (31Trusted Source).\nAnother 4-week study had 32 healthy young men consume a diet consisting of 20% of calories from pistachios.\nIt found that endothelium-dependent vasodilation improved by 30%, compared with when they followed a Mediterranean diet (26Trusted Source).\nIn one study, men with erectile dysfunction experienced a 50% improvement in parameters of erectile function after eating 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of pistachios a day for 3 weeks (27Trusted Source).\nPerhaps not surprisingly, studies have shown that eating pistachios can help promote healthy blood sugar levels.\nOne study showed that when 2 ounces (56 grams) of pistachios were added to a carb-rich diet, healthy individuals\u2019 blood sugar response after a meal was reduced by 20\u201330% (6Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nIn another 12-week study, individuals with type 2 diabetes showed a 9% reduction in fasting blood sugar after eating 0.9 ounces (25 grams) of pistachios as a snack twice per day (33Trusted Source).\nIn addition to being rich in fiber and healthy fats, pistachio nuts are rich in antioxidants, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds, all of which are beneficial for blood sugar control (6Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nPistachios are a great source of healthy fats, fiber, protein, antioxidants, and various nutrients, including vitamin B6 and thiamine.\nTheir health effects may include weight loss benefits, lower cholesterol and blood sugar, and improved gut, eye, and blood vessel health.","2":"They\u2019re called nuts, but botanically\u00a0pistachios are seeds.\nYou can buy pistachios shelled or unshelled, roasted, or salted.\nThey\u2019re available in most grocery stores, and you can buy them in bulk from pistachio growers.\nPistachios are bursting with the fiber, minerals, and unsaturated fat that can help keep your\u00a0blood sugar,\u00a0blood pressure, and cholesterol in check.\nBuying pistachios in their shells slows down your eating.\nSome studies suggest that eating pistachios lowers the amount of fat and sugar (glycemic index) in your blood, as well as improves the flexibility and tone of your blood vessels.\nAlthough raw pistachios don\u2019t have much sodium (1 cup has about 1 milligram), that\u2019s not true for roasted pistachios, which are often salted.\nA cup of dry roasted pistachios with salt has 526 milligrams of sodium.\nPistachios can sometimes be tricky to eat since they have a tough shell.\nIf there\u2019s a crack in the shell, you can use the shell of another pistachio to pry it open.\nGo nuts to lower your heart risk.\u201d Harvard T.H.
