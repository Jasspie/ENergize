such as, drought, heat stress, etc.\nPlanting tomatoes too close together encourages foliar diseases and reduces fruit production due to reduced light penetration to lower leaves.\nWaterlogged soils cause unhealthy yellowish plants, root rot and eventual death if the situation is prolonged.\nDry soils cause poor fruit development, blossom-end rot and eventual death if the situation is prolonged.\nZippering scars on a tomato are not completely understood, but may be caused by an anther from the flower sticking to the fruit as it develops possibly because of high humidity.\nTomato cultivars are sometimes selected for their resistance to various problems.\nDisease resistance is listed but also resistance to some environmental problems are included.\nPossible descriptions include crack resistant, zippering resistant, heat tolerant, cold tolerant, salt tolerant, humidity tolerant, adaptable to a range of soil types, no green shoulders or a combination of these.\n3. Avoid planting outside until nighttime temperatures are consistently above 55 degrees.\n8. Avoid use of herbicides near plants.\nIf the above methods do not correct the problem, get a soil test, which will include a test for organic matter and pH.\nPlant tomatoes in a container.","2":"LCAs consider environmental impacts at each phase of the life cycle (raw material production, manufacturing, use, etc.) Our study quantified resource use, including energy, water, and other resources, and\u00a0estimates emissions that may contribute to critical environmental impacts, including global warming, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone creation, acidification, and eutrophication, for bulk tomato paste and diced tomatoes.\nBetween 2005 and 2015, environmental improvements were observed in both final paste and diced tomato products.\nEfficiency of energy use and water use increased

Health Benefits of Tomatoes | Health.com"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Tomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition The content of vitamins and plant compounds in tomatoes can vary greatly between varieties and sampling periods (8, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nWhen the ripening process starts, the chlorophyll (green) is degraded and carotenoids (red) are synthesized (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nLycopene \u2014 the most abundant carotenoid in ripened tomatoes \u2014 is particularly noteworthy when it comes to the fruit\u2019s plant compounds.\nGenerally, the redder the tomato, the more lycopene it has (19Trusted Source).\nTomato products \u2014 such as ketchup, tomato juice, tomato paste, and tomato sauces \u2014 are the richest dietary sources of lycopene in the Western diet, providing over 80% of dietary lycopene in the United States (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nGram for gram, the amount of lycopene in processed tomato products is often much higher than in fresh tomatoes (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nConsuming this plant compound with a source of fat can increase absorption by up to four times (25Trusted Source).\nEven though processed tomato products are higher in lycopene, it\u2019s still recommended to consume fresh, whole tomatoes whenever possible.\nConsumption of tomatoes and tomato-based products has been linked to improved skin health and a lower risk of heart disease and cancer.\nA study in middle-aged men linked low blood levels of lycopene and beta-carotene to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nClinical studies of tomato products indicate benefits against inflammation and markers of oxidative stress (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nObservational studies have noted links between tomatoes \u2014 and tomato products \u2014 and fewer incidences of prostate, lung, and stomach cancers (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nWhile the high lycopene content is believed responsible, high-quality human research needed to confirm the cause of these benefits (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nA study in women shows that high concentrations of carotenoids \u2014 found in high amounts in tomatoes \u2014 may protect against breast cancer (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nTomato-based foods rich in lycopene and other plant compounds may protect against sunburn (41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).\nAccording to one study, people who ingested 1.3 ounces (40 grams) of tomato paste \u2014 providing 16 mg of lycopene \u2014 with olive oil every day for 10 weeks experienced 40% fewer sunburns (43Trusted Source).\nStudies show that tomatoes and tomato products may reduce your risk of heart disease and several cancers.\nThis fruit is also beneficial for skin health, as it may protect against sunburns.\nWhen tomatoes start to ripen, they produce a gaseous hormone called ethylene (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).\nTomatoes are generally well tolerated and tomato allergy is very rare (47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source).\nIn oral-allergy syndrome, your immune system attacks fruit and vegetable proteins that are similar to pollen, which leads to allergic reactions like itching in the mouth, scratchy throat, or swelling of the mouth or throat (50Trusted Source).\nPeople with latex allergy can also experience cross-reactivity to tomatoes (51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source).\nThey are especially high in lycopene, a plant compound linked to improved heart health, cancer prevention, and protection against sunburns.\nThis article discusses the potential health\u2026 Lycopene is an antioxidant found in red and pink fruits that has been linked to various beneficial effects.","1":"Botanically, tomatoes are a fruit because they contain seeds and the plant produces a ripened flower ovary.\nHowever, most recipes that include tomatoes treat them like a savory vegetable.\nTomatoes offer many significant health benefits.\nTomatoes contain the antioxidant lycopene, which may provide several health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers.\nThe lycopene in tomatoes supports healthy skin by protecting it from some of the harmful effects of sun damage.\nVitamin A, also found in tomatoes, promotes skin health, as well.\nThe calcium and Vitamin K in tomatoes play a role in strengthening and repairing bones, including bone tissue.\nTomatoes contain Vitamin B and potassium, which may reduce cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure.\nThe Vitamin A in tomatoes supports the eye's structure and may improve night vision for people with vision impairment.\nTomatoes provide many health benefits.\nTo use tomatoes for homemade pasta sauce and other recipes, you can steam them and remove the skin.","2":"That's due in part to their lower carb and sugar contents: A medium tomato provides just 22 calories, and about 5 grams of total carb, with 3 as sugar and 1.5 as fiber.\nWhat's more, tomatoes supply vitamin A, which supports immunity, vision, and skin health; vitamin K, which is good for your bones; and potassium, a key nutrient for heart function, muscle contractions, and maintaining a healthy blood pressure and fluid balance.\nTomatoes contain an antioxidant called lycopene, which is responsible for their red color.\nOther studies have shown that higher blood levels of lycopene are tied to lower death rates for people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that raise the chances of developing heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.\nAnd that's not the only peeper-protective nutrient in tomatoes; they contain lutein and beta-carotene as well.\nTomatoes may be a protective food for people with type 2 diabetes: In one study, people with diabetes who supplemented with cooked tomatoes for 30 days experienced a decrease in lipid peroxidation, a chain reaction in which substances called free radicals attack fat, leading to damage that ups the risk of heart disease.\nA 2011 study found that the combination of tomato paste and olive oil protected against sun damage, and boosted the production of pro-collagen, a molecule that gives the skin its structure and keeps it firm and youthful.\nScientists believe that the lycopene in tomatoes is key.\nIt\u2019s at its highest concentration when tomatoes have been cooked, and olive oil boosts its absorption from your digestive system into your bloodstream."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/tomatoes","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-tomatoes","2":"www.health.com\/nutrition\/health-benefits-tomatoes"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
