The event was the brainchild of then Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, and it was a watershed moment for the growing U.S. environmental movement: Americans had become increasingly aware that the same industrialization that had made the country wealthy was having an impact on the environment and their own health.\nAs famed anchorman Walter Cronkite put it in a special CBS News broadcast, Earth Day participants had a \u201ccommon cause of saving life from the deadly by-products of that bounty: the fouled skies, the filthy waters, the littered earth.\u201d That same year would see the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the first in a series of important environmental laws.\nSince then efforts to tackle various environmental ills have waxed and waned: while enormous strides have been made in curbing air pollution, the threat of climate change has emerged and mushroomed.\nOne of the worst air pollution disasters in the nation\u2019s history came in the fall of 1948, when weather conditions caused a stew of smog to build up in the industrial town of Donora, Pa., sickening thousands and killing 20 people.\nCongress passed various laws to limit air pollution in the ensuing years, but the Clean Air Act of 1970 was the landmark legislation that truly ushered in the stringent and comprehensive regulation of emissions from power plants, factories and cars.\nThe graphs below show how the law and its subsequent revisions have led to notable nationwide drops in three major pollutants: nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and lead.\nAnother landmark law, this act addressed pollution entering waterways from industry, sewage facilities and agriculture.\nThe first of them shows the change in levels of phosphorus\u2014one of the key nutrients that fuel toxic algal blooms\u2014carried into Lake Erie by the Maumee River, which flows into the lake in Toledo.\nThe graph for Lake Michigan shows a different type of pollutant: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which can cause cancer as well as other health effects.\nAnd although levels of the compounds in the air (from which these chemicals fall into the water) and in fish have declined, their presence is still high enough that some states warn people to limit consumption of fish from the lakes.\nAmericans are producing a lot more garbage than they did 50 years ago\u2014and not just because the country\u2019s population has risen: each person in the U.S. generates an average of 4.5 pounds of waste a day, compared with just 3.25 pounds in 1970.\nThat change reflects the explosion of plastic products over the past few decades, from less than 50 million tons of the material produced in 1970 to more than 320 million tons today.\nSubscribers get more award-winning coverage of

advocacy groups.[1]","2":"An environmental impact is defined as any change to the environment, whether adverse or beneficial, resulting from a facility\u2019s activities, products, or services.[2] In other words it is the effect that people's actions have on the environment.\nOther activities causing harm include improper waste disposal to bodies of water and soil, accidental spills of chemicals, increased demand for resources as populations increase (especially due to consumerism), and much more.\nThe environmental impact a specific action may have can be analyzed using a life cycle assessment, which is the process of observing a product from its \"cradle to grave\" and determining the impacts associated with it at each step.[3] These methods are somewhat subjective and resource intensive.[2] Emission inventories for example may quantify the emission of pollutants, while risk assessments can analyze the effects these pollutants will have on the health of those within the environment."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/how-the-environment-has-changed-since-the-first-earth-day-50-years-ago\/","1":"en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_environmental_dates","2":"energyeducation.ca\/encyclopedia\/Environmental_impact"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

| Organic Facts"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving provides the following nutrients (1): Dates are also high in antioxidants, which may contribute to many of their health benefits (2Trusted Source).\nIn one study, 21 people who consumed 7 dates per day for 21 days experienced improvements in stool frequency and had a significant increase in bowel movements compared to when they did not eat dates (4Trusted Source).\nFiber slows digestion and may help prevent blood sugar levels from spiking too high after eating (5Trusted Source).\nFor this reason, dates have a low glycemic index (GI), which measures how quickly your blood sugar rises after eating a certain food (6Trusted Source).\nDates provide various antioxidants that have a number of health benefits to offer, including a reduced risk of several diseases.\nAntioxidants protect your cells from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that may cause harmful reactions in your body and lead to disease (7Trusted Source).\nCompared to similar types of fruit, such as figs and dried plums, dates appear to have the highest antioxidant content (8Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, animal studies have shown dates to be helpful for reducing the activity of amyloid beta proteins, which can form plaques in the brain (13Trusted Source).\nOne animal study found that mice fed food mixed with dates had significantly better memory and learning ability, as well as less anxiety-related behaviors, compared to those that did not eat them (16Trusted Source).\nThe potential brain-boosting properties of dates have been attributed to their content of antioxidants known to reduce inflammation, including flavonoids (13Trusted Source).\nEating these fruits throughout the last few weeks of pregnancy may promote cervical dilation and lower the need for induced labor.\nThey may also be helpful for reducing labor time (17Trusted Source).\nIn one study, 69 women who consumed 6 dates per day for 4 weeks prior to their due date were 20% more likely to go into labor naturally and were in labor for significantly less time than those who did not eat them (18Trusted Source).\nAnother study of 154 pregnant women found that those who ate dates were much less likely to be induced compared to those who did not (19Trusted Source).\nAlthough eating dates appears to help promote labor and reduce labor duration, more research is needed to confirm these effects.\nThey are also a good source of natural sugar and calories, which are necessary to maintain energy levels during labor (20Trusted Source).\nDates are a source of fructose, which is a natural type of sugar found in fruit.\nThey make a great healthy substitute for white sugar in recipes due to the nutrients, fiber and antioxidants that they provide.\nThe best way to substitute dates for white sugar is to make date paste, as in this recipe.\nIt is important to note that although dates are high in fiber and nutrients, they are still fairly high in calories and best consumed in moderation.\nThey are high in several nutrients, fiber and antioxidants, all of which may provide health benefits ranging from improved digestion to a reduced risk of disease.\nIt\u2019s easiest to find dates in their dried form, though these are higher in calories than fresh fruit so it is important to eat them in moderation.\nFruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants.\nThis is a detailed article about dried fruit and its health effects.\nDried fruit is very nutritious, but also contains a lot of sugar and calories.\nThese 12 foods are high in antioxidants and can help keep your cells healthy.\nThese 16 tips to add more fiber to your diet may improve digestion, help you lose weight and lower your risk of disease.","1":"Here are seven ways dates can protect your health, and simple ways to incorporate this super fruit into meals, snacks, drinks, and treats.\nIn addition to their vitamin and mineral content, dates are rich in health protective antioxidants.\nOne recent paper, published in the Journal of Pharmacy & BioAllied Sciences, states that dates are a good source of natural antioxidants, which can be used for the management of oxidative stress\u2013related illnesses.\nAnd because dates are whole, unprocessed fruit, their sugar content is naturally occurring.\nIn other words, if an energy bar is sweetened only with dates, the label can list 0 grams of added sugar.\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that women consume no more than six teaspoons of added sugar per day, which equates to 25 grams or 100 calories.\nOne study, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, looked specifically at the impact of date consumption on the gut.\nHealthy men were randomly assigned to eat either seven dates per day, or a control addition of a carbohydrate and sugar mixture for 21 days.\nResearchers found that while eating dates, the study subjects experienced improvements in their bowel movement frequency and a reduced level of stool chemicals known to damage cells and trigger mutations that may lead to cancer.\nAt the end of the month, researchers found that the date addition did not significantly affect the body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels of the study subjects.\nMost important, fasting blood glucose and blood fat levels did not increased after consuming either date variety.\nAnother more recent study tested date consumption on both blood fats and glycemic control.\nAnd HbA1c (a measure of blood sugar control over the previous two- to three-month period) did not change in the date eaters.\nThe group that consumed dates also experienced improvements in mental health and measures of overall quality of life.\nA paper published in the journal Neural Regeneration Research states that dates have promising therapeutic potential against Alzheimer\u2019s disease, due to their ability to combat inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.\nResearchers reviewed previously published studies and concluded that eating dates may reduce the duration of the active phase of labor, the stage during which the cervix dilates.","2":"The powerful health benefits of dates include providing an energy boost, increasing iron in the body, and aiding digestion.\nRich in various nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants, dates are popular throughout the world.\nEach date is about 60 to 70 percent sugar and has a high amount of fiber, depending on the variety, which makes it ideal as a healthy energy booster.\nAccording to USDA\u00a0FoodData Central, dates are a good source of energy, fiber, sugar, and various vitamins and minerals.\n[5] A 2008 review published in\u00a0Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition journal by Cornell researchers Chang Yong Lee and Mohamed Ali Al-Farsi suggests that over 15% of the daily requirement of essential minerals such as copper, potassium, magnesium, and selenium can be fulfilled by consuming 100 grams, or about 4 pitted dates per day.\nMany people around the world eat natural low-fat dates for a quick afternoon snack when they are feeling lethargic or sluggish\u00a0to help bump up energy levels fast.\nA\u00a0study\u00a0published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition\u00a0suggests that dates rich in essential nutrients\u00a0may help you regain your energy immediately.\nAccording to research, \u201cdate palm fruits are a good source of dietary fiber and are rich in total phenolics and natural antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and caffeic acid\u201d.\nA 2005 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry also\u00a0suggests that these dried fruits have high levels of dietary fiber and insoluble fiber, in particular.\nThe insoluble fiber\u00a0found in dates promotes healthy\u00a0digestion by bulking up the stool and may also aid in\u00a0relieving the symptoms of constipation.\nResearch suggests\u00a0dates\u00a0contain insoluble and soluble fibers, as well as many beneficial amino acids which can stimulate the digestion of food and ensure quick passage through the gastrointestinal tract.\nAccording to a review published in the Journal of Nutrition Reviews, the fiber may also aid in the treatment of conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diverticulitis, and hemorrhoids.\nFortunately, increasing your intake of iron-rich foods such as dates could help provide relief from anemia symptoms.\nin the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry\u00a0concluded\u00a0that consuming dates was effective at reducing triglyceride levels and decreasing oxidative stress, both of which are risk factors for heart disease and atherogenesis, which is the build-up of fatty plaque in the arteries.\nIn 2006, an animal\u00a0study\u00a0revealed\u00a0the effects of date palm pollen and its oil on sexual functioning, reporting that the high levels of estradiol and flavonoid components in dates are helping increase sperm count and motility.\n[22] Each date is about 60 to 70 percent sugar and has a high amount of fiber, which makes it a healthy energy booster.\nAccording to an article\u00a0in the Heart Views journal, dates are rich in carotenoids, which may help prevent night blindness and preserve healthy vision.\n[23] According to an article published\u00a0by the Columbia University Medical Center, foods rich in potassium such as dates can help replace and replete electrolytes that you may have lost due to chronic diarrhea.\nThanks to their high fiber content, they can also aid in digestion and may alleviate the unpredictable nature of chronic diarrhea.\nA study published in the Journal of Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition suggests that\u00a0significant amounts of minerals such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium found in dried fruits make them a superfood for strengthening bones and fighting off painful and debilitating diseases like osteoporosis.\n[25] [26] Organic pitted dates contain selenium, manganese, copper, and magnesium, all of which may aid in managing bone health, particularly amongst older adults.\nAccording to USDA, these dried fruits are rich in sugar along with\u00a0proteins, and many other essential vitamins and minerals.\nThey are also high in fiber, which can aid in weight management.\n[27] An animal study conducted in 2014 suggested that intake of dates may\u00a0aid in weight gain.\nThe study published in Inflammatory Research\u00a0found that date palm immunotherapy was effective at decreasing several markers of inflammation in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nFinally, keep in mind that dried dates are relatively high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health issues if consumed in excess.\nHealth benefits of apple cider vinegar include its ability to\u00a0regulate blood sugar levels, boost
