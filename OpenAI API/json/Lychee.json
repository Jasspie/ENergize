pleasant fragrance and a sweet flavour.\nAckees are the national fruit of Jamaica and have a slightly savoury taste.\nThe lychee and ackee plants belong to the soapberry family, or the Sapindaceae, and contain similar toxins.\nIn specific circumstances, unripe lychees can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and a dangerous brain dysfunction that may be deadly.\nAckee fruits that are not ripe can cause severe vomiting and other unpleasant symptoms.\nLychees and ackee fruits are both available in North America, at least in some places and at some times of the year, either in fresh or canned form.\nCare is needed when choosing and preparing them, however, especially in the case of ackee fruits.\nB. navez, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License The lychee or litchi plant is an evergreen flowering tree that is native to China.\nTheir taste and nutrients make them a great fruit to eat.\nIt's important that they're ripe, however, at least until we have a better understanding of the fruit's potential toxicity.\nUnripe lychees are completely green in colour.\nEver since the 1990s, investigators have been seeking an explanation for the puzzling deaths of Indian children after eating lychees.\nThe analysis was based on poisonings that occurred in 2014 in an area containing many orchards with lychee trees.\nThe poisonings took place from May to July, which is the lychee season, and were absent during the rest of the year.\nThe affected children visited the orchards and ate lots of lychees.\nAfter eating unripe fruit, the children went to bed without exhibiting any symptoms.\nThe researchers discovered that many of the affected children\u2014especially those that died\u2014didn't eat evening meals or ate only small ones.\nIt's possible that hunger was the reason for the willingness of some children to eat unripe lychees.\nThe researchers found that many of the children ate so many lychees that they didn't want an evening meal even when it was available, however.\nThe combination of eating a large number of lychees without eating an adequate amount of other food produced the most serious symptoms.\nUnripe lychees contain two toxins\u2014methylenecyclopropyl glycine or MCPG and hypoglycin A.\nThe investigators found metabolites of the toxins in many of the children that ate the unripe fruit.\nTherefore, after eating a sufficient number of unripe lychees children may experience hypoglycemia.\nThis harms the brain and is responsible for the dangerous and distressing symptoms of lychee poisoning.\nThe synergistic combination of litchi consumption, a missed evening meal, and other potential factors such as poor nutritional status, eating a greater number of litchis, and as yet unidentified genetic differences might be needed to produce this illness.\nThe investigators say that the solution to the lychee problem is for parents to warn their children about eating the fruit and to ensure that the children get a good evening meal.\nUnfortunately, in 2019 the lychee season caused more children to die in northern India, where the trees grow well.\nAs of mid June in that year, 31 children had died after eating the fruit.\nThese ackee fruits haven't opened up and are therefore unripe and dangerous to eat.\nJerome Walker, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License Like the lychee plant, the ackee plant (Blighia sapida) is an evergreen tree.\nThe edible part of the fruit is the cream or pale yellow flesh or aril round the seeds.\nThe cooked ackee is a rich yellow colour and looks a lot like scrambled eggs.\nIt's very important to eat only ripe ackee fruits and to eat only the properly prepared aril.\nAckee poisoning is also known as Jamaican vomiting illness.\nChildren are more likely to die from the illness.\nSome of the symptoms of the illness are the same as ones found in lychee poisoning.\nAs the alternate name for the illness suggests, severe vomiting is a dominant symptom of ackee poisoning.\nVomiting occurred in some of the children investigated in the lychee poisoning analysis, but not in most of them.\nSome common symptoms of ackee poisoning are listed below.\nI've eaten lychees, which are available in stores and restaurants during the summer where I live.\nI haven't eaten ackee, however, and have never seen it in the stores.\nIf it was available I wouldn't eat it unless I could prepare it myself or unless I was confident that it was prepared by someone who knew how to deal with the fruit.\nUnripe fruit contains a high level of hypoglycin A and is very poisonous.\nRipe fruit still contains hypoglycin A, but the level is much lower.\nIf the ackee is washed and then cooked in water, the amount of toxin should fall to a safe level.\nExperts in dealing with the fruit give the following advice for making ackee safe to eat.\nRik Shuiling\/TropCrop, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License Canned lychees are available throughout the year where I live.\nCanned ackee is available in some places.\nThis may sound like a safer product than the fresh fruit and would certainly be easier to use.\nIf I was thinking of buying canned ackee, I would do some research about the product and its manufacturer first.\nUnripe lychees seem to be dangerous only under certain conditions; unripe ackees seem to be dangerous for many of us.\nBoth fruits can be interesting additions to the diet but need to be treated with respect.\nThanks for introducing us to foods that need to be processed safely before we consider eating them.\nI remember trying canned lychee once but have never seen or tasted ackee.\nI think that lychees are an interesting fruit.\nI love lychees and they were so abundant in Cambodia that we ate these all the time.\nI haven't seen ackee where I live, either, but I expect it's available in stores that sell imported food.\nI've changed it.) These ackee fruits are fascinating, aren't they.\nI don't recall any of us ever eating a green lychee, as the exterior is green when unripe and red when ripe.\nSounds like an interesting fruit.\nDeep and very interesting sturdy on the ackee and lychee fruits.\nThe good news is that that it seems that we need to eat a lot of unripe litchis before we get sick.\nThese Ackee fruits have an extraordinary resemblance to human kidneys, complete with the adrenal gland up top.\nI enjoy eating fruits that I've never tried before, although I do like to learn something about them before I put them in my mouth!\nThe food that we eat has a bigger effect on our lives than just providing calories.\nI don't mind eating ripe lychees when I can find them, but I wouldn't eat unripe ones.\nDry informative hub about Lychees and Ackee fruits!\nThanks for commenting and for sharing the interesting and useful information, Larry.\nLychees are available where I live, too.\nAckee and saltfish sounds like an interesting meal.\nI have Lychees in china restaurants,  I never head of the Ackee fruits.\nThanks for the valuable information on these two foods.\nI am not familiar with the lychee but I like ackee and saltfish.\nI feel sad for the children who died because they ate the ackees.\nLike many of your hubs, this is vital information for those who eat such fruit.\nI've never heard of Ackee but it's very interesting too.\nI enjoy eating lychees, too.\nI love lychee's."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.ishs.org\/ishs-article\/321_73","1":"www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/agricultural-and-biological-sciences\/lychee","2":"owlcation.com\/stem\/Lychees-and-Ackee-Fruits-Toxins-and-Their-Effects"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"ERROR","1":"ERROR","2":"

Facts"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"They\u2019re a good source of several vitamins, minerals, and healthy antioxidants.\nLychees are mainly composed of water and carbs \u2014 which make up 82% and 16.5% of the fruit, respectively (1Trusted Source).\nThe table below shows the main nutrients in fresh lychees (1Trusted Source): Besides water, lychees are mainly composed of carbs.\nA single lychee \u2014 either fresh or dried \u2014 contains 1.5\u20131.7 grams of carbs (1Trusted Source).\nLike other fruits, lychees are a good source of various antioxidant plant compounds.\nIn fact, they have been reported to contain higher levels of antioxidant polyphenols than several other common fruits (4Trusted Source).\nHowever, as it\u2019s not found naturally in lychee fruits, its health effects don\u2019t apply to lychees.\nLike most fruits and vegetables, lychees are a good source of antioxidants and other healthy plant compounds.\nHowever, including a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet may improve your health and reduce your risk of several chronic diseases (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nLychees contain several healthy minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, such as potassium, copper, vitamin C, epicatechin, and rutin.\nAnimal studies also indicate that lychee extract may help fight liver cancer (17Trusted Source).\nStill, further studies are needed to confirm the health benefits of lychees in humans.\nHowever, they contain several nutrients and antioxidants that are important for health.\nWhen eaten in moderation as a part of a healthy diet, lychees do not have any known adverse health effects.\nThey have a sweet and flowery flavor and are a good source of vitamin C and several beneficial antioxidants.\nFruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants.\nMany tropical fruits are full of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that help boost health and fight disease.\nHere are nine worth tracking down \u2014\u2026 Eating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.","1":"Not only is it packed with antioxidants and micronutrients, but it\u2019s also rich in several powerful key compounds that can work wonders when it comes to your health.\nIn addition to its versatility and distinct perfume-like flavor, this tropical fruit is also jam-packed with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, making it a great addition to a healthy, well-rounded diet.\nLychee is loaded with vitamin C, an important water-soluble vitamin that doubles as an antioxidant to fight free radical damage and optimize immune health.\nInterestingly enough, a 2006 study published in the\u00a0Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism found that meeting the daily recommended intake of vitamin C was effective at reducing symptoms and shortening the duration of certain respiratory infections like the common cold.\nAntioxidants are important compounds that help fight free radicals and prevent oxidative damage to the cells.\nPlus, research shows that antioxidants may also support long-term health and can aid in the prevention of chronic conditions, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.\nStudies show that lychee can help control inflammation to support overall health.\nAccording to an in vitro study published in the journal\u00a0PLoS One, a flavonol-rich extract of lychee fruit was effective at suppressing the expression of certain genes involved in the inflammatory process.\nThis fruit is also high in antioxidants, which are compounds that can help reduce inflammation and prevent the buildup of free radicals in the body.\nResearch suggests that adding lychee to your diet may help support blood sugar control to help you maintain normal blood sugar levels in the long term.\nOne animal study conducted by the\u00a0National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan also reported that lychee extract could help decrease insulin resistance in mice to support healthy blood sugar levels.\nCombating insulin resistance by consuming fiber can improve your body\u2019s ability to use insulin efficiently to help manage blood sugar levels.\nFor example, one animal model out of China showed that certain compounds found in the seeds of the fruit were able to improve cognitive function and prevent injury to the neurons in rats with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nIn addition to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects of this tropical fruit, some research shows that it may possess powerful antiviral properties as well.\nIn fact, one in vitro study published in the journal\u00a0Molecular Vision showed that lychee flower extract was effective at blocking the growth and spread of herpes simplex virus in corneal cells.\nAccording to a 2017 review published in\u00a0Nutrients, the pulp, peel and seed of the lychee fruit all contain potent compounds that can inhibit tumor formation and block cancer cell growth.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that these studies look at the effects of highly concentrated compounds found within lychee when administered to isolated cancer cells in a laboratory.\nAdditional research is needed to evaluate how this fruit may affect cancer growth in humans when consumed as part of a healthy diet.\nHowever, because of its warming properties, it\u2019s advised to keep lychee consumption in moderation to reduce the risk of adverse effects on health.\nIt contains a good amount of several important nutrients, including manganese, niacin and vitamin C, but in lower concentrations than the lychee fruit.\nThe mangosteen, meanwhile, is a fruit that grows mostly in tropical regions like Southeast Asia, India and Puerto Rico.\nLike the lychee, it contains a high amount of fiber per cup, plus a modest amount of key nutrients, like vitamin C and magnesium.\nStudies have found that consuming high amounts of unripe lychee fruit on an empty stomach could cause a condition called hypoglycemic encephalopathy in children, likely due to the presence of a compound called\u00a0methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid found in the seeds of the fruit.\nFor this reason, it\u2019s typically advised for children to keep lychee consumption in moderation and to eat after an evening meal to avoid dips in blood sugar levels that could contribute to symptoms.\nKeep in mind that lychee is also a relatively high-sugar fruit and contains a good chunk of calories per serving.\nPlus, fruit canned in syrup may be even higher in sugar, so it\u2019s important to keep intake under control to avoid adverse health effects like weight gain and high blood sugar.","2":"Lychee is a wonderful fruit with plenty of health benefits, including its ability to\u00a0aid in weight loss, protect the skin, boost the immune system, prevent cancer, improve digestion, build strong bones, lower blood pressure, defend the body against viruses, improve circulation,\u00a0and optimize metabolic activities.\nThey are highly eminent\u00a0in countries around the world because of their health and medicinal benefits, which are due to the wealth of nutrients and organic compounds present in them.\nHowever, far more nutrients are present in dried lychee than in fresh lychee, so if you want to consume this for your overall health, forgo the sweet smell and allow the fruit to dry.\n[3] Along with helping you enhance your appearance, lychee also helps in treating digestive issues, increasing blood circulation, cancer prevention, and much more.\nThe significant amount of dietary fiber in lychee, as in most fruits and vegetables, helps add bulk to your stool and increases your digestive health.\nIt also helps reduce abdominal obesity, according to a study cited in the Journal of Functional Foods.\n[4] [5] [6] Perhaps the most significant nutrient in lychee is vitamin C, and this fruit has more than 100% of the daily requirement of ascorbic acid in a single serving.\nThis means that your immune system gets a major boost, as vitamin C is a major antioxidant compound and is known to stimulate the activity of white blood cells, which are the main defensive line of your body\u2019s immune system.\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock Research by the Division of Experimental Oncology, National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China shows that lychee fruit pericarp\u00a0contains polyphenolic compounds that show antioxidant activity.\n[9] Lychee is a rich source of organic compounds, so it can be consumed as an effective preventative measure of various cancers.\n[10] A 2006 study shows that lychee fruit pericarp extract has the ability to induce apoptosis as well as inhibit cell proliferation of breast cancer cells.\n[12] The latest research published in the Nutrients journal suggests that lychee has some therapeutic effects that can help in the treatment of colon cancer.\n[13] Researchers from the\u00a0Southwest Medical University have published a study in the\u00a0Nutrients journal which highlights the neuroprotective effect of lychee seeds.\nFurthermore, Dr. Mahesh Thirunavukkarasu et al., University of Connecticut Health Center, USA, in a study has revealed that oligonol derived from lychee fruit too is a vasodilator.\n[16] This powerful phenolic compound found in lychee has been connected to a number of important health benefits, including anti-influenza activity, an improvement in blood circulation, reduction in weight, and the protection of your skin from harmful UV rays when exposed to the sun.\nTherefore, the copper content in lychee can boost blood circulation and increase oxygenation of the organs and cells.\nAlso, lychees are considered a \u201chot\u201d food, meaning that they can sometimes unbalance the body\u2019s nutrient levels.\nHealth benefits of apple cider vinegar include its ability to\u00a0regulate blood sugar levels, boost weight loss,\u00a0improve skin & gut health, & lower cholesterol levels.Read
