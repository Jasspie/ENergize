collard greens and various cabbages.\nThere are several related Chinese cabbages that are all sold as bok choy.\nAlso note that the word \u201cbok\u201d is also transliterated from the Chinese in some places as \u201cpak,\u201d so you might see it for sale as \u201cpak choy.\u201d In \u201cStir-Frying to the Wok\u2019s Edge\u201d, Chinese cooking expert Grace Young explains that what\u2019s labeled as bok choy is most likely the large (8 to 11 inches tall) fully grown bunch, with white stalks and dark green leaves.\nOccasionally, bok choy and other Chinese cabbages will have black flecks on the ribs, known as \u201cpepper spot.\u201d This is a harmless cosmetic condition that doesn\u2019t impact taste or texture.\nAlthough available year-round in supermarkets, bok choy is a cool-weather crop (like kale, it\u2019s frost resistant) and shows up at farmers\u2019 markets and in CSA boxes during spring and fall.\nCalifornia is one of the main producers growing Chinese cabbage on a large scale, along with Arizona and Florida, but it\u2019s an increasingly common crop on vegetable farms across the country.\nBecause the stalks take considerably longer to cook than the leaves, many chefs recommend blanching (parboiling) it for 60 seconds before stir-frying or braising.\nThis is fine if you\u2019re braising \u2013 gently cooking in a sauce \u2013 but if just-blanched bok choy is wet, it will steam rather than sear in the hot oil.\nCook the stalks first, time depending on size, then add the leaves, which typically take no more than two minutes to wilt.\nBok choy is classically used in Chinese and Japanese cooking, and is a great addition in stir-fry, curries, and soups."},"environment_urls":{"0":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31201960\/","1":"link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10646-020-02344-8","2":"foodprint.org\/real-food\/bok-choy\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

daily recommended intake in a single cup serving.","1":"This article discusses the health benefits and potential downsides to eating bok choy, and suggests a few ways to incorporate it into your diet.\nSimilar to other leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, bok choy is full of health-promoting nutrients, including a wide array of vitamins and minerals.\nScientists have studied the cruciferous vegetable family for its potential anticancer benefits.\nOne study found that eating bok choy at least once per week was associated with a significantly lower risk of oral, esophageal, colorectal, breast, and kidney cancers, compared with never or occasionally consuming bok choy (10Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, bok choy is a rich source of the mineral selenium, which may also have anticancer benefits.\nIn one analysis of studies, researchers found that high selenium exposure, indicated by levels in the blood or toenails, was related to a lower risk of cancers of the breast, lungs, esophagus, stomach, and prostate (11Trusted Source).\nAnother analysis of studies concluded that high intake of cruciferous vegetables, like bok choy, was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer (12Trusted Source).\nOne study found that having a low level of selenium in the bloodstream was associated with thyroid conditions, such as hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and enlarged thyroid, also called goiter (13Trusted Source).\nOne study found that taking selenium supplements also helped manage these conditions (14Trusted Source).\nStudies have found that reduced levels of these minerals are associated with collagen reduction and an increased risk of osteoporosis, a disease in which bones soften and become prone to fracture (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nBok choy contains the minerals potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which work to help naturally regulate your blood pressure (17Trusted Source).\nHaving unmanaged high blood pressure can be a risk factor for developing heart disease (18Trusted Source).\nBok choy is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may offer benefits for thyroid function and heart and bone health.\nWhile bok choy offers a number of health benefits, it may also come with downsides for some people when consumed in large amounts.\nThis effect may really only be a concern if you eat an unusually large amount of raw cruciferous vegetables over an extended period.\nHowever, the researchers state that typical serving sizes of bok choy probably do not impair thyroid function (1Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, because bok choy is a rich source of vitamin K, you may not want to consume it in larger amounts if you take blood thinning medication.\nThis is because vitamin K plays a role in blood clotting (24Trusted Source).\nA 1-cup (70-gram) serving of loosely packed, chopped bok choy provides about 27% of your daily vitamin K needs (2Trusted Source).\nOne case study suggests that eating bok choy raw in very large amounts may interfere with thyroid function, but this is probably not a concern with typical serving sizes.\nBok choy is a cruciferous, leafy green vegetable native to China.\nIt offers a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, as well antioxidants and fiber that are good for your health.\nBoy choy is also high in vitamin K, so you may want to eat less or avoid it if you take blood thinning medications.\nHere are 14 of the healthiest leafy green vegetables you\u2026 Cruciferous vegetables are low-calorie, and rich in folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and fiber.","2":"This article examines the nutritional values and potential benefits of bok choy.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database, here are the nutritional values per 3.5 oz (100g) serving of bok choy (2).\nAs shown in the nutritional values, bok choy is extremely low in calories and contains minimal amounts of carbohydrates, fat, and protein.\nOn this note, cruciferous vegetables contain sulfur-containing compounds known as glucosinolates (5, 6).\nFurther research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the potential effects of glucosinolates on human health.\nMany leafy greens contain high amounts of oxalic acid, which is otherwise known as oxalate (12, 13).\nIt should be noted that foods containing oxalic acid are often very nutritious, and they are not an issue for most healthy people.\nOn the positive side, bok choy is a leafy green with one of the lowest oxalate contents among all vegetables (17).\nBok choy is a significant dietary source of polyphenols, and it contains various flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids (18, 19, 20).\nPurple bok choy varieties include \u2018rubi\u2019 and \u2018purple hybrid,\u2019 and they contain high concentrations of anthocyanins (27, 28).\nResearch also shows that purple bok choy contains higher amounts of other polyphenols such as kaempferol and quercetin (33).\nAs shown in the nutritional values section, bok choy is an excellent dietary source of vitamins A and C.\nHowever, none of these compounds are preformed vitamin A (otherwise known as retinol).\nBased on the provitamin A content of bok choy, a 100-gram serving contains 223.5 mcg of retinol activity equivalents (RAE).\nBok choy also contains a significant amount of vitamin C, which is equivalent to 50% of the daily value per 100 grams (2, 3).\nOne potential downside of\u00a0raw bok choy is that it contains several enzymes collectively known as myrosinase.\nThis nutritious green vegetable offers large amounts of vitamins and minerals for a minimal amount of calories.\nAlthough further research is necessary, bok choy may also offer additional benefits from the polyphenols and glucosinolates that it contains."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-bok-choy","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/bok-choy-nutrition","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/bok-choy-nutrition-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
