One of the antioxidants in spinach, called lutein, has been shown to reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur the sharp, central vision required for activities like reading and driving.\nIn one Japanese study, researchers examined the eyes of 11 healthy nonsmokers who consumed 75 grams of frozen spinach containing 10 mg of lutein daily for two months.\nThis research indicates that spinach may help curb AMD risk.\nWhile I recommend incorporating spinach into both raw and cooked dishes, some research shows that not cooking the greens is the best way to preserve its lutein content.\nThe longer the spinach was boiled, the lower the remaining lutein level.\nScientists say the best way to consume spinach for maximum lutein intake may be in a smoothie combined with a healthful fat, such as avocado or almond butter.\nThat\u2019s because when spinach is chopped into small pieces, more lutein is released from the leaves, and fat increases the ability to absorb the antioxidant.\nOlder research found that cooking also impacts the folate content of spinach; boiling slashed this B vitamin level by nearly half.\nA recent study looked at the effect of different cooking methods on the vitamin content in selected vegetables, included spinach.\nCooking also diminished the vitamin E levels in spinach, but increased the vitamin A content.","1":"Eating spinach may benefit eye health, reduce oxidative stress, help prevent cancer, and reduce blood pressure levels.\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw spinach are (1Trusted Source): Most of the carbs in spinach consist of fiber, which is incredibly healthy.\nSpinach is high in insoluble fiber, which may boost your health in several ways (2Trusted Source).\nSpinach is extremely healthy and linked to numerous health benefits.\nIt has been shown to improve oxidative stress, eye health, and blood pressure.\nThey can cause oxidative stress, which triggers accelerated aging and increases your risk of cancer and diabetes (11Trusted Source).\nHowever, spinach contains antioxidants, which fight oxidative stress and help reduce the damage it causes.\nOne study in eight healthy people found that spinach helped prevent oxidative damage.\nHuman eyes also contain high quantities of these pigments, which protect your eyes from the damage caused by sunlight (15Trusted Source).\nEating this leafy green may also help prevent breast cancer (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nLikewise, one animal study notes that spinach might suppress cancer formation (26Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, spinach packs high amounts of antioxidants, which may also fight cancer (27Trusted Source).\nSpinach contains high amounts of nitrates, which have been shown to help moderate blood pressure levels and decrease your risk of heart disease (28, 29).\nOne study in 27 people found that eating spinach effectively lowered blood pressure levels.\nSeveral other studies observed similar effects, indicating that spinach boosts heart health (7Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nIt may reduce oxidative stress, promote eye health, fight cancer, and regulate blood pressure.\nPeople who are taking blood thinners, such as warfarin, should consult with their healthcare practitioner before eating large amounts of spinach (34Trusted Source).\nThis leafy green is also very high in vitamin K1, which can be a problem for people on blood thinners.\nThis vegetable has been shown to benefit health in several ways.\nSpinach may decrease oxidative stress, improve eye health, and help prevent heart disease and cancer.\nThis article compares spinach and kale to\u2026 Packed with nutrients but low in calories, leafy greens are crucial to a wholesome diet.\nSome studies show that it can help you lose\u2026 Spinach is packed with nutrients and antioxidants.","2":"This article will provide a science-backed guide to spinach and its health benefits.\nAs shown in the table, spinach is a very low-energy food and contains a minimal amount of calories.\nSpinach is a rich source of minerals, and it is particularly high in vitamin K1 and carotenoid vitamin A precursors.\nSpinach is a rich source of manganese and magnesium, and it contains a range of other minerals in small to moderate amounts.\nMost of the health benefits\u00a0that spinach can confer relate to the nutrients it provides.\nAdditionally, spinach contains some interesting compounds such as kaempferol and nitrate, and these compounds may have a beneficial impact on our body.\nSpinach is one of the biggest food sources of provitamin A carotenoids.\nIn contrast to bio-available vitamin A (retinol) found in oily fish, eggs, and organ meats, carotenoids are not in a form the body can readily use (4).\nTo use carotenoids, our body must first convert these compounds into retinol.\nHowever, because spinach still contains such a large amount of carotenoids, this would still provide benefit.\nAdditionally, some carotenoid compounds have further interesting effects rather than just vitamin A activity.\nResearchers suggest that the efficiency at which humans absorb the vitamin K in spinach could be as low as 10% (7).\nWe can also increase the absorption rate of all fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) by consuming them alongside a source of fat.\nAmong vegetable sources of vitamin C, spinach is one of the best, and it provides almost 50% of the RDA per 100 grams.\nSpinach is rich in dietary folate, and it contains 49% of the RDA per 100 grams.\nHowever, since these foods are often a rich source of nutrients and\u00a0phytonutrients, it is likely that they can help to boost various measures of our health.\nThis natural compound can accumulate in plants growing in nitrate-rich soil, and it can have some beneficial effects when we\u00a0consume it.\nKaempferol is a flavonoid polyphenol which we can find in certain plant foods, and spinach is a particularly high source (23).\nAs mentioned earlier, spinach is a significant source of carotenoid compounds.\nSpinach is one of the most concentrated sources of oxalate out of all food (28).\nHowever, realistic servings of spinach are not a problem for the majority of people, and many different foods also contain oxalic acid.\nOverall, spinach is a very healthy food that has a range of health benefits.\nIt is rich in vitamins and minerals, and it contains some other bioactive compounds that may further benefit our health.\nFor more on leafy greens, see this guide to the potential benefits of kale."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.health.com\/nutrition\/groceries\/7-health-benefits-spinach","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/spinach","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/spinach-nutrition-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
