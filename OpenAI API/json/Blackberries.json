Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"This article examines eight benefits of consuming blackberries and summarizes their impressive nutrition profile.\nBlackberries have several interesting health benefits ranging from their nutrient values to potential benefits from the phytonutrients they contain.\nBlackberries provide around 50% of the RDI for vitamin C per cup, which works out at 35% per 100 grams (3).\nPolyphenols are a type of phytochemical believed to have numerous potential health benefits.\nNotably, blackberries are one of the most concentrated sources of polyphenols out of all foods.\nAlthough this vitamin tends to be present in greater quantities in leafy greens and green vegetables, blackberries supply a reasonable source.\nInterestingly, a recent study found that eating blackberries instead of different carbohydrate sources may increase fat oxidation and heighten insulin sensitivity.\nNotably, there were significantly improved blood glucose, fat oxidation, and insulin sensitivity results in the blackberry group.\nBlackberries have an interesting nutrition profile because they are one of the lowest carbohydrate fruits, but also one of the highest in fiber.\nAs a result, this makes blackberries an excellent low-carb, high-fiber fruit option.\nPer 100 grams, these berries provide 10.2 grams of carbohydrate, 5.3 grams of which is fiber (3).\nFirst of all, calories are not a determinant of whether or not food is healthy.\nHowever, blackberries offer a decent range of nutrients for minimal calories, which makes them reasonably nutrient-dense.\nOngoing research has been examining the health properties of different berries, particularly for potential cardiovascular benefits.\nFurthermore, a systematic review of berry-based food interventions for cardiovascular risk identified 17 high-quality randomized controlled trials.\nAlthough blackberries contain beneficial nutrients, they are also a source of fructose (fruit sugar).\nAs shown, blackberries are low in calories and primarily a source of (fibrous) carbohydrate.\nAlthough they contain a wide range of further vitamins, none of these are in high concentrations.\nWhile this fruit is very healthy, no single food can make or break our health, and it is our overall diet that matters the most.\nHowever, blackberries do contain numerous beneficial nutrients, they are also full of polyphenols, and high-quality studies suggest some potential health benefits.\nNutrition Advance provides evidence-based food and nutrition articles.","1":"While many fruits deliver a wonderful combination of nutrition and flavor, few provide as many impressive health benefits as blackberries.\nToday, we enjoy access to a wide variety of blackberries, including not only wild and domesticated versions, but also varieties categorized as trailing, erect, and semi-erect.\nThe antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals found in blackberries deliver a variety of health benefits.\nBlackberries are an excellent source of insoluble fiber.\nBlackberries are one of several types of berries believed to have a positive impact on insulin resistance and triglyceride levels.\nAs such, researchers view blackberries as beneficial for diabetes management, especially if eaten fresh or frozen.\nResearch suggests that an increased intake of blackberries may address obesity by increasing insulin sensitivity and helping the body burn fat more effectively.\nBlackberries are a great source of antioxidants.\nWhen picking blackberries, look for plump, firm berries with a deep black color.\nFood & Function: \"Dietary Berries, Insulin Resistance And Type 2 Diabetes \u2014 An Overview of Human Feeding Trials.\" Harvard T.H.

few cases have been noted in medical literature.\nA random survey revealed that mold growth in blackberries and raspberries were the highest among all of the tested berries and grapes.8\ufeff Thorough washing of blackberries prior to eating may reduce the risk of an allergic response to mold.\nAside from their color difference, blackberries can be distinguished from raspberries by their shape.\nRaspberries and blackberries are botanically related (they are both from the Rubus family).\nBlackberries can also be found frozen, and make a great, more affordable addition to smoothies and baked goods than fresh options.\nWhen choosing\u00a0fresh blackberries, let color be your guide.\nOnce you have purchased blackberries, try to eat them within a day or so.\nIf you cannot eat them immediately, you can freeze the berries for up to a year.\nTo prevent blackberries from getting moldy, refrain from washing\u00a0until right before serving.\nYou can use blackberries in most any recipe calling for berries (like strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries).\nGet nutrition tips and advice to make healthy eating easier.\nAnthocyanin content, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties of blackberry and raspberry fruits.\nAnthocyanin suppresses the toxicity of A\u03b2 deposits through diversion of molecular forms in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease.\ndoi:10.1179\/1476830515y.0000000042 American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.05.002  There was an error."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/blackberries-nutrition-benefits\/","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-blackberries","2":"www.verywellfit.com\/blackberry-nutrition-facts-calories-and-health-benefits-4109221"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 50","1":" 90","2":" 50"}}
