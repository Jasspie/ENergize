relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nas long as pesticides have not been used, be sure to buy Non-GMO\/organic, as toxic, chemical pesticides contaminate air, water, soil, etc.\nCucumbers are high in nutrients, hydrating (have a high water content), contain antioxidants, provide potassium and magnesium and are good sources of fiber.\nYes, cucumbers are plant based since they are a fruit.\nPlant based foods include fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds that are best when fresh and unprocessed.\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".* High blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is less common among\u00a0vegans.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nCucumbers are a type of fruit, therefore making it a gluten free food.\nDo cucumbers have a high or low water footprint?\nCucumbers have a low water footprint.\nWhat is the water footprint of cucumbers?\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nDo cucumbers have a high or low carbon footprint?\nCucumbers have a low carbon footprint.\nIt takes around 0.14 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of fresh cucumbers, a car driving equivalent of 0.5 miles or 0.75 kilometers, USA market data.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nCucumbers are a fruit and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nAre cucumbers a product that has known labor issues?\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"","2":"\"My research is about the environmental impacts of cucumber production in Spain, Austria and Sweden and I analyze the results in two perspectives: the consumer and the producer perspective.\nIt compares the carbon footprint of imported organic cucumbers from Spain and the local conventional

vitamins and minerals.\nCucumbers are low in calories but high in water and several important vitamins and minerals.\nAt the end of the 30-day study, cucumber powder caused a significant increase in several markers of antioxidant activity and improved antioxidant status (5Trusted Source).\nAnother test-tube study investigated the antioxidant properties of cucumbers and found that they contain flavonoids and tannins, which are two groups of compounds that are especially effective at blocking harmful free radicals (6Trusted Source).\nCucumbers contain antioxidants, including flavonoids and tannins, which prevent the accumulation of harmful free radicals and may reduce the risk of chronic disease.\nWhile you meet the majority of your fluid needs by drinking water or other liquids, some people may get as much as 40% of their total water intake from food (2Trusted Source).\nFruits and vegetables, in particular, can be a good source of water in your diet.\nThey found that increased fruit and vegetable intake was associated with improvements in hydration status (10Trusted Source).\nBecause cucumbers are composed of about 96% water, they are especially effective at promoting hydration and can help you meet your daily fluid needs (2Trusted Source).\nCucumbers are composed of about 96% water, which may increase hydration and help you meet your daily fluid needs.\nFurthermore, the high water content of cucumbers could aid in weight loss as well.\nOne analysis looked at 13 studies including 3,628 people and found that eating foods with high water and low calorie contents was associated with a significant decrease in body weight (11Trusted Source).\nSeveral animal and test-tube studies have found that cucumbers may help reduce blood sugar levels and prevent some complications of diabetes.\nCucumbers were shown to effectively reduce and control blood sugar levels (12Trusted Source).\nCucumber peel reversed most of the diabetes-associated changes and caused a decrease in blood sugar (13Trusted Source).\nIn addition, one test-tube study found that cucumbers may be effective at reducing oxidative stress and preventing diabetes-related complications (14Trusted Source).\nTest-tube and animal studies show that cucumber may help lower blood sugar and prevent diabetes-related complications, although additional research is

antioxidant activity, cucumbers have a detoxifying, cleansing effect on the body.\nSeveral bioactive compounds have been isolated from the nutritious cucumber, including cucurbitacins, glucosides, lignans, apigenin and flavonols like fisetin.\nAs such, eating plenty of high-antioxidant foods\u00a0like cucumbers may help lower your risk of cancer.\n2.
