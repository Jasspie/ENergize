population.\nIn reality, only 400 million of the 300 billion pineapple fruits farmed annually are Hawaiian crops, which is about .13 percent.\nThe US does not even figure in the top five producers of pineapples in the world,\u00a0with\u00a0the Philippines and Brazil coming in at the top, followed by Costa Rica.\nPineapples make up 20 percent of tropical fruit production in the world.\nCosta Rican pineapple production has doubled over the past 10 years, making it the largest supplier of the European Union.\nIt is the United States, however, that imports the most pineapple of any country on earth with\u00a090 percent of it coming from Costa Rica.\nIn short, the pineapple industry is one of human rights violations and environmental issues, all for crops of luxury fruits.\nThe secret to the overwhelming success of the pineapple industry in Costa Rica is an enormous amount of migrant workers from Nicaragua.\nThese people arrive and start working in Costa Rica without any papers, meaning the companies they work for can have them deported at the smallest sign of trouble.\nPineapple production relies on a huge amount of chemical pesticide use and monocultures (intense production of only one crop.)\u00a0Click here to read an academic journal on the importance of soil health and plant health, and the connections to mono-cropping.\nThis means that intense rain fall carries the pesticides away from the \u00a0agriculture site into water supplies.\nNew developments surrounding GMO crops are taking place in Costa Rica.\nThe company, Del Monte, will continue testing in Costa Rica, with potential sales in the U.S. one day.\nThe potential for genetically modified pineapple to be available to American consumers will certainly generate more controversy if it comes to pass.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news down in Costa Rica, however.\nConsumers International wrote a report last year about what is being improved in the pineapple industry in Costa Rica.","1":"Health and environmental degradation has affected both workers and local communities.\nAlthough this benefits Costa Rican producers and European supermarkets, an investigation by Consumers International (an umbrella group for independent consumer organizations across Europe) and The Guardian newspaper in the UK found environmental and social damage caused by intensive fruit production there.\nThey use chemicals that are dangerous for the environment and human health \u2026 Some of the plantations have used paraquat, for example, to clear the soil at very, very high doses, 10 to 15 times the normal dose on other crops; it\u2019s banned in Europe.\nThe video that was produced follows some workers and local communities affected by the production of pineapples.\nThe large scale, industrial, mono-production of pineapple means a lot of intensive chemical use as noted earlier.\nThis, together with various accidents and chemical spillages has resulted in local water contamination, soil degradation and other environmental and health problems.\nThis would seem good for consumers, but it seems the retailer is able to directly or indirectly squeeze the producers and it is ultimately the workers that are affected the most.\nIf that 4 pence per pound was enough to pay a livable wage, without exploitation and with reasonable working hours, then it would not seem so bad for the workers, perhaps (though the health and environmental damage would still remain as major issues).\nFor consumers that are seemingly many miles away from the source of their foods, and are also facing financial squeezes of their own, given the debilitating global financial crisis, it can be easy to forget these issues.","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.onegreenplanet.org\/animalsandnature\/problematic-pineapples-the-human-and-environmental-cost-of-your-fruit\/","1":"www.globalissues.org\/article\/789\/pineapples","2":"hrmars.com\/papers_submitted\/2937\/A_Preliminary_Study_on_Sustainable_Management_of_Pineapple_Waste_Perspective_of_Smallholders.pdf"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

compounds have been linked to many health benefits, including aiding digestion, boosting immunity and speeding up recovery from surgery, among others.\nMeanwhile, manganese is a naturally occurring mineral that aids growth, maintains a healthy metabolism and has antioxidant properties (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThese free radicals interact with the body\u2019s cells and cause damage that is linked to chronic inflammation, a weakened immune system and many harmful diseases (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nPineapples are especially rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids and phenolic acids (7Trusted Source).\nPineapples are a good source of antioxidants, which may reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.\nPineapples contain a group of digestive enzymes known as bromelain (10Trusted Source).\nPineapples contain bromelain, a group of digestive enzymes that breaks down proteins.\nSeveral studies have shown that pineapple and its compounds may reduce the risk of cancers.\nTest-tube studies have shown that bromelain may also help fight cancer (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nFor instance, two test-tube studies showed that bromelain suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells and stimulated cell death (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nTest-tube and animal studies have found that bromelain may stimulate the immune system to produce molecules that make white blood cells more effective at suppressing cancer cell growth and eliminating cancer cells (16Trusted Source).\nPineapple contains compounds that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are linked to cancer.\nThey contain a wide variety of vitamins, minerals and enzymes like bromelain that may collectively boost immunity and suppress inflammation (23).\nAlso, children who ate the most pineapple had close to four times more disease-fighting white blood cells (granulocytes) than the other two groups (24Trusted Source).\nSince pineapples contain bromelain, which has anti-inflammatory properties, it\u2019s commonly thought that they may provide pain relief for those with inflammatory arthritis (30Trusted Source).\nIn fact, research from as early as the 1960s shows that bromelain was used to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, a type of arthritis that involves inflammation of the joints (31Trusted Source).\nOne study in patients with osteoarthritis found that taking a digestive enzyme supplement containing bromelain helped relieve pain as effectively as common arthritis medicines like diclofenac (32).\nIt concluded that bromelain has the potential to relieve arthritis symptoms, especially in the short term (30Trusted Source).\nLonger studies are needed before recommending bromelain to relieve arthritis symptoms.\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of pineapple may provide short-term symptom relief for people with common types of arthritis.\nSeveral studies have shown that bromelain may reduce the inflammation, swelling, bruising and pain that often occurs after surgery.\nProteases like bromelain are believed to speed up the recovery of damage caused by strenuous exercise by reducing inflammation around the damaged muscle tissue (35Trusted Source).\nOne study tested this theory by providing participants a digestive enzyme supplement that contained bromelain after 45 minutes of strenuous exercise on the treadmill.\nSeveral other studies have shown that bromelain can speed up recovery from damage caused by exercise (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).\nThe bromelain in pineapples may reduce the inflammation, swelling, bruising and pain that occurs after surgery.\nBromelain\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties may also aid recovery after strenuous exercise by reducing tissue inflammation.\nTheir nutrients and compounds have been linked to impressive health benefits, including improved digestion, a lower risk of cancer, improved immunity, relief of arthritis symptoms and improved recovery after surgery and strenuous exercise.","1":"Pineapple is a large tropical fruit with a spiky, tough skin and sweet insides.\nThe scaly bumps on the outside are called \"eyes.\" Slice it open, and you'll find bright yellow flesh that's both sweet and tart.\nYou can buy bromelain supplements over the counter, along with skin creams that have bromelain in them.\nYou may have an itchy tongue or sore lips right after you eat pineapple.\nBecause bromelain breaks down proteins, it can \"eat away\" at your flesh.\nBut as soon as you swallow the fruit, your stomach acids destroy the flesh-eating enzyme.\nSome people have an allergy to pineapple.\nOnce you've cut it, you can cover pineapple and leave it out on the counter.\nU.S.

that garnishes our drinks, but did you know that it also provides a good dose of\u00a0vitamin C, vitamin B1, potassium and manganese, in addition to other special compounds and antioxidants that help prevent disease formation?\nBenefits of pineapple include protecting against cardiovascular disease, improving fertility and reducing inflammation.\nMuch of the healing power of this fruit comes from a protein-digesting enzyme called\u00a0bromelain.\nA pineapple fruit can weigh up to eight pounds and produces fruit that is both sweet and tart, containing fiber-like pectin that gives the fruit its chewy texture.\nBecause of the many health benefits of pineapple, the fruit quickly became popular on ships since it offers natural prevention against scurvy, a common health issue at the time.\nThis enzyme may help speed healing and acts as an anti-inflammatory medication, similarly to over-the-counter medications like aspirin and ibuprofen.\nAdditionally when applied topically, the benefits of bromelain include its ability to help in healing cuts, burns, insect bites, and to help dissipate bruising\u00a0and other skin problems.\nRecent studies also show that bromelain helps stop lung metastasis in its tracks, which suggests that it can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases.\nBecause of the vitamin C content in it, this amazing fruit can help your body fight off\u00a0free radical damage\u00a0and reduce\u00a0inflammation,\u00a0which are known to contribute to the development of cancer.\nFruits that are high in\u00a0fiber\u00a0may help to lower your risk of colorectal cancer.\nBecause of its high fiber content and volume, one of the benefits of pineapple is that it can help to make you feel full with little calories.\nAccording to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, studies show that eating foods that are rich in antioxidants can help prevent\u00a0infertility.\nBecause free radicals can damage the reproductive system, foods with high antioxidant activity like pineapples are recommended for people who are trying to conceive.\nIn terms of pineapple benefits for men, antioxidants have been shown to help increase blood flow and restore proper tissue formation in the genital organs \u2014 plus they can assist in boosting sperm count.\nSimilarly, benefits of eating pineapple for a woman include reducing inflammation and supporting connective tissue healing.\nThe benefits of pineapple extend to heart health because of its fiber, potassium, vitamin C and antioxidant content.\nOne study\u00a0conducted on rats found that one of the benefits of pineapple juice is that it has cardioprotective abilities.\nThe study concluded that pineapple juice can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and help establish digestion and absorption.\nFruits that are high in potassium can also help lower high blood pressure.\nPineapples also help improve heart health because of the effects of powerful bromelain, which can fight blood clotting and is nature\u2019s answer to those taking an aspirin a day to lower the risk of heart attack.\nThe beta-carotene that is found in plant foods like pineapples may help to lower the risk of respiratory inflammation and asthma.\nAll of these factors cause inflammation, but luckily one of the benefits of pineapple is that it can help reduce inflammation through its detoxifying capabilities.\nAnother one of the benefits of pineapple is that its nutrients may help improve your mood and\u00a0fight depression and anxiety.\nThe benefits of pineapple include the ability to help those suffering from\u00a0arthritis\u00a0and\u00a0joint pain.\nA study done at Duke University Medical Center that was conducted on 100 mice who suffered from colitis (inflammation of the colon) showed that long-term dietary supplementation with fresh or unpasteurized frozen pineapple juice with active bromelain enzymes is safe and effectively decreases inflammation severity.\nThe study showed that the bromelain found in pineapples caused a significantly faster recovery than standard therapy.\nFor digestion, eating pineapple serves as a powerful aid in breaking down proteins into peptides and amino acids.\nWhile it doesn\u2019t typically have laxative effects, it provides fiber, water and electrolytes (like most fruits and veggies do) that can aid in regularity.\nBromelain also seems useful in helping\u00a0prevent\u00a0autoimmune\u00a0responses due to common food allergies.\nStudies have found evidence that eating pineapple may help those who had celiac disease, an allergy to the protein gluten that is found in wheat, barley and rye products, due to the presence of the bromelain enzyme.\nTo get the benefits of pineapple in\u00a0your diet, you can eat it by itself as a snack, or you can add it to both sweet and savory dishes.\nHowever, if the acid in pineapples gives you a stomachache when you eat it alone, try having it with a bigger meal, including one that provides some protein and fat.\nPineapple itself is hydrating, since it contains a lot of water (like all fruit).\nHowever, drinking water with high-fiber foods is a good idea for improving digestion.\nKeep in mind that, as mentioned above, eating lots of fresh pineapple or drinking pineapple juice will not effectively provide a sufficient dose of treatment because most of the bromelain is found in the core and stem of the fruit.\nOne of the easiest ways to benefit from pineapple and fresh pineapple juice is to add some to a vitamin-packed smoothie.\nIt is not a commonly allergenic fruit, and because of the bromelain, it actually helps with digestion.\nThe bromelain that is found in pineapple may interact with some medications, and this is something that you can mention to your health care provider."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-pineapple","1":"www.webmd.com\/food-recipes\/benefits-pineapple","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-pineapple\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
