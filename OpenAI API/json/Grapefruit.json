Griffith Hughes, who described specimens from Barbados in The Natural History of Barbados.[1][9][10] However, Hughes's forbidden fruit may have been a plant distinct from grapefruit although still closely related to it.[citation needed] In 1814, naturalist John Lunan published the term grapefruit to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant.[7] Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (Vitis vinifera).[11] An alternative explanation offered by Tussac (1824) is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes.[12] After this, authors of the period used both terms forbidden fruit and grapefruit as synonyms.[citation needed] In 1830, the Jamaican version of the plant was given the botanical name Citrus paradisi by botanist James Macfadyen.[13] Macfadyen identified two varieties \u2013 one called forbidden fruit, the other called Barbadoes Grape Fruit.\nLater, Kim (1990) found a different citrus called forbidden fruit or shaddette in Saint Lucia that is closely related to grapefruits and may be the plant described by Hughes and Macfadyen.[citation needed] The name grape-fruit was used more and more during the 19th century to refer to pomelos, to the consternation of some.[14] The grapefruit was brought to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor.[1] Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984).[citation needed] Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s.\nIts improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.[21] The 'Star Ruby' is the darkest of the red varieties.[1] Developed from an irradiated 'Hudson' grapefruit ('Hudson' being a limb sport of 'Foster', itself a limb sport of the 'Walters'),[22] it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.[23][24] In 2019, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.3 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the world total.\nSecondary producers were Vietnam, the United States, and Mexico.[25] Grapefruits are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies such as A.\nThis parasitism has led to millions in economic costs for nations in Central America and southern North America.[27] Grapefruit varieties are differentiated by the flesh color of fruit they produce.\nCommon varieties are yellow and pink pulp colors.\nFlavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart, resulting from composition of sugars (mainly sucrose), organic acids (mainly citric acid), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes providing aromas.[28] Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the aroma compounds influencing taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.[29] Grapefruit and grapefruit juice have been found to interact with numerous drugs and in many cases, to result in adverse direct and\/or side effects (if dosage is not carefully adjusted.)[30] This happens in two very different ways.","1":"In total, 21 types of fruit and 46 fresh and processed products produced in the UK and abroad are considered to estimate the impacts at both the product and the national levels.\nProcessing leads to high impacts of fruit

powerful health benefits, including weight loss and a reduced risk of heart disease.\nGrapefruit is low in calories and also provides a significant amount of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nIt\u2019s prized for its high content of vitamin C, which has antioxidant properties known to protect your cells from harmful bacteria and viruses (2Trusted Source).\nMany other vitamins and minerals found in grapefruit are known to benefit immunity, including vitamin A, which has been shown to help protect against inflammation and several infectious diseases (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\nGrapefruit may benefit your immune system, as it contains several vitamins and minerals known for their role in preventing infection.\nResearch shows that a diet high in fiber-rich fruits is beneficial for inducing feelings of fullness.\nThus, consuming adequate amounts of fiber may automatically help you eat fewer calories throughout the day by keeping your appetite at bay (14Trusted Source).\nIt has several properties linked to weight loss, especially its fiber content, which helps promote fullness and reduce calorie intake (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, grapefruit contains few calories but lots of water, which is another characteristic known to help with weight loss (18Trusted Source).\nOne study in 91 obese subjects found that those who consumed half of a fresh grapefruit before meals lost significantly more weight than those who didn\u2019t (19Trusted Source).\nFor instance, one study found that participants experienced a reduced waist size when they consumed grapefruit daily with their meals (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nEating grapefruit before meals may be helpful for weight loss.\nIts fiber and water can promote fullness and reduce calorie intake.\nInsulin resistance ultimately leads to higher insulin and blood sugar levels, two primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nEating grapefruit may help control insulin levels and thus have the ability to reduce your likelihood of becoming insulin resistant (19Trusted Source).\nIn one study, subjects who ate half of a fresh grapefruit before meals experienced a significant reduction in both insulin levels and insulin resistance, compared to the group that didn\u2019t eat grapefruit (19Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, eating fruit as a whole is generally associated with better blood sugar control and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).\nGrapefruit may help reduce insulin resistance, which can lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nRegularly consuming grapefruit is thought to improve heart health by reducing risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.\nAdequate potassium intake is associated with a reduced risk of high blood pressure.\nSecond, the fiber in grapefruit may also boost heart health, given that a high fiber intake is associated with lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels (17Trusted Source).\nOverall, researchers claim that including fiber and antioxidant-rich fruits like grapefruit as part of a healthy diet helps protect against conditions like heart disease and stroke (11Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nGrapefruit contains nutrients and antioxidants shown to help protect the heart by regulating blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nGrapefruit contains a few different antioxidants that provide various health benefits, including a reduced risk of several diseases (33Trusted Source).\nGrapefruit contains several types of antioxidants that may help prevent the development of some chronic conditions, including heart disease and cancer.\nThe citric acid in grapefruit may help reduce the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones.\nIf you eat grapefruit while taking these medications, your body may not be able to break them down, which could cause an overdose and other adverse effects (44Trusted Source).\nCitric acid, which is found in citrus fruits, is a common cause of enamel erosion, especially if you consume it in excess (45Trusted Source).","1":"Because it is low in calories and a good source of fiber and vitamin C, grapefruit can be a smart addition to your diet.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for one half of a raw, medium, pink or red grapefruit (123g) measuring approximately 3 3\/4\" in diameter.1\ufeff Grapefruit is a low-carb fruit.\nHalf of a medium-sized grapefruit contains fewer carbohydrates and sugar than a typical serving of fruit.\nAccording to USDA data, there are about 13 grams of carbs in a half grapefruit.\nThere are also 2 grams of fiber in a half grapefruit.\nThe glycemic load of half a grapefruit (without any added sugar or honey) is estimated to be 4.\nOne half of a medium grapefruit has approximately 0.2g of fat.\nGrapefruit is an excellent source of vitamin C, providing nearly 64% of your daily needs in a single serving.\nIt's also an excellent source of beta carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A), providing 28% of your daily needs.\nThe vitamins in grapefruit provide several health benefits.\nStudies have shown that taking supplements containing vitamin A, vitamin C, and other nutrients can reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25%.4\ufeff Other experts have investigated dietary sources of key nutrients important for eye health.\nIn one published study, grapefruit and grapefruit juice were listed as key dietary sources.5\ufeff Pink grapefruit contains\u00a0the antioxidant\u00a0lycopene, which gives it its beautiful pink hue.\nA 2015 study suggested\u00a0that eating a lycopene-rich diet may decrease prostate cancer risk.6\ufeff But the topic of vitamin C and cancer prevention has been hotly debated and researchers are not sure if vitamin C supplements or consuming more vitamin C foods can really provide this benefit.7\ufeff Research has shown that eating\u00a0grapefruit is associated with lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and increased HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels in the blood.\nIt may also help to lower blood pressure in overweight adults.8\ufeff Researchers who study cardiovascular risk disease factors have investigated grapefruit consumption along with the consumption of other fruits like blueberries, pomegranate, and apples.\nIn a published review, study authors concluded that other fruits were associated with greater benefits with regards to heart health, but that fruit consumption, in general, is likely to help modulate related conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and overweight\/obesity.9\ufeff Grapefruits contain flavanones which are a subclass of flavonoids.\nFlavonoids have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombogenic, antidiabetic, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities.10\ufeff There are reports of citrus allergy, but the condition is considered to be uncommon.11\ufeff So while grapefruit allergies are possible, but not likely.\nIf you have an allergy to citrus you should avoid grapefruit.\nYou should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice if you take lipid-lowering (cholesterol-lowering) medications called statins.\nThese may include medications such as Zocor (simvastatin) or Lipitor (atorvastatin).12\ufeff Compounds found in grapefruit can interact with the enzymes in your intestines that help your body absorb some types of statins.\nThe interference can affect the levels of statin medications in your blood.13\ufeff According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), grapefruit and grapefruit juice can also interfere with other prescription and over-the-counter medications.12\ufeff Grapefruit contains a class of compounds called furanocoumarins, which act in the body to alter the characteristics of certain types of medications.\nAnti-anxiety drugs such as buspirone, corticosteroids, and certain organ-transplant rejection drugs may also become less effective if you consume grapefruit.12\ufeff Ingesting grapefruit with these medications can cause the body to metabolize the medicines abnormally.\nGrapefruit varieties include pink, white, or ruby red.\nWhite grapefruit has a pale, yellow color on the outside and a pinkish, whitish inside.\nIt's believed that the antioxidant content of citrus fruit increases as it ripens, so choosing a fully-ripe grapefruit is ideal.15\ufeff If you plan on eating your grapefruit right away, leave it out at room temperature.\nLike many citrus fruit rinds, grapefruit peel is safe to consume.\nIt even contains some fiber and other nutrients.16\ufeff You'll want to wash the fruit before consumption as it may contain bacteria or debris.\nTrying pairing grapefruit with avocado and greens for a refreshing citrus salad, or chop up some grapefruit to make a sweet, tart relish for meats.\nMany recipes combine heart-healthy avocado with ruby-red grapefruit.\nGrapefruit, raw, pink and red, all areas.\ndoi:10.1089\/wound.2012.0415 Vitamin A Fact Sheet for
