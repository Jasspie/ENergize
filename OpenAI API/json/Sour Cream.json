Niamsiri, C.A. Batt, in Encyclopedia of Microbiology (Third Edition), 2009 Sour cream, also known as cultured cream, is produced by the fermentation of high-pasteurized cream that contains 18\u201320% fat content.\nThe starter cultures typically used for making sour cream are aromatic starters (i.e., Lc. lactis subsp.\nAs lactic acid is produced by the bacteria, the homogenization clusters aggregate, resulting in highly viscous cream.\nMarsili, in Reference Module in Food Science, 2016 Sour cream and buttermilk depend for their flavor on the combined action of strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp.\ncremoris to produce lactic acid and on Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.\ncremoris and citrate-positive (Cit+) strains of Lc. lactis for production of aroma chemicals (especially diacetyl).\nExcessive lactic acid from over-ripening or improper incubation temperature (or delayed cooling\/under-cooling) makes the finished product taste acrid and gives it a coarse mouthfeel.\nThe desired lactic acid level in good-flavored buttermilk is 0.75\u20130.85%.\nTrace amounts of acetic, formic, propionic, and\/or pyruvic acids also are formed in secondary metabolic reactions in cultured buttermilk and sour cream; these relatively volatile acids impart a pleasant acid flavor.\nThe critical \u02bbbuttery\u02bc nutlike flavor characteristic of most cultured dairy products is attributed to diacetyl, a potent fragrance compound.\nDiacetyl is derived from the fermentation of citric acid by Ln. mesenteroides subsp.\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been used to monitor changes in organic acids during buttermilk fermentation (Figure\u00a03), while static headspace gas chromatography has been used to monitor volatile organics (Figure\u00a04).\nChanges in the concentration of organic acids in cultured buttermilk during a typical fermentation, as determined by HPLC.\nChanges in the concentration of volatile organic compounds in cultured buttermilk during a typical fermentation as determined by headspace GC.\nChemical changes that occur during storage of buttermilk at refrigerated temperatures are shown in Table 2.\nChanges in concentration of organic acids (high-performance liquid chromatography) and volatile organic compounds (headspace gas chromatography) in buttermilk made from skim milk, at end of fermentation, and after an additional week of refrigerated storage Reproduced with permission from Marsili, R.T., 1981.\nMonitoring bacterial metabolites in cultured buttermilk by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography.\nJ.A.

can be part of a healthy diet as long as it is consumed in moderation The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for about two tablespoons (29g) of sour cream.1\ufeff Sour cream is a high-calorie but low-carbohydrate food.\nThe glycemic index of sour cream is estimated to be about 56, making this a low to moderate glycemic food.\nThere are 5.6 grams of fat in regular sour cream.\nFat-free sour cream provides zero grams of fat but has a higher carb count (5g) and just 23 calories.\nLight sour cream provides about 3.4g of fat and has about 43 calories.\nA single serving of regular sour cream is not a significant source of protein, providing under one gram.\nBecause a single serving of sour cream does not provide significant micronutrients and no significant macronutrients except for fat, it is not likely to provide substantial health benefits.\nIn fact, the USDA states that foods made from milk that have little to no calcium are not considered part of the Dairy Group and the organization does not include those foods (such as cream or cream cheese) in their recommended guidelines.2\ufeff There are different ways that sour cream may play a very small role in certain health outcomes.\nWhile experts at the USDA recommend that we consume fat-free or low-fat dairy to reduce our intake of saturated fat3\ufeff other experts have provided research supporting the fact that this recommendation may not be the optimal strategy for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk.\nIn fact, some studies have even found an inverse association between fermented dairy intake (including sour milk products) and mortality or cardiovascular disease risk.4\ufeff However, sour cream is not fully fermented so it is unclear if this benefit is applicable.\nIn general, low-fat dairy products are considered a smart choice when trying to reach or maintain a healthy weight.\nIn fact, some studies have even found that increasing low-fat dairy foods to 4\u20135 servings per day may be beneficial for weight loss or maintenance.5\ufeff But this recommendation is made based on the fact that dairy products usually provide important nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D.\nSour cream, as it is typically consumed, is not a good source of either nutrients.\nThose with milk or dairy allergy should not consume dairy products including sour cream.\nSymptoms of a dairy allergy include rashes, hives, itching, swelling, and may become more severe including trouble breathing, wheezing, or loss of consciousness.6\ufeff If you have lactose intolerance you may develop symptoms if you consume sour cream.\nUpdated 4\/1\/2020 What foods are in the Dairy Group?\nEffects of full-fat and fermented dairy products on cardiometabolic disease: food Is more than the sum of

dietary fats is now inexcusable, and sour cream is enjoying a resurgence as a health food.\nThis article will take a look at the nutritional value of sour cream and eight significant health benefits.\nKey Point: As shown above, sour cream has a healthy nutritional profile and contains a range of beneficial nutrients.\nOne of the biggest benefits of sour cream is that it is high in dairy fat.\nKey Point: The vast majority of studies over the last decade suggest that dairy fats are healthy and protective against disease.\nThe dairy fat content is one of the best health benefits of sour cream.\nAs we saw from the nutrition tables, sour cream contains a broad range of nutrients.\nOne serving of sour cream contains approximately 13% of the RDA for phosphorus.\nHowever, animal foods such as sour cream supply vitamin A in its pre-formed state.\nA half cup of sour cream contains around 13% of the RDA for vitamin A.\nKey Point: One of the advantages of sour cream is that it supplies a decent amount of riboflavin, vitamin A and phosphorus.\nNot only do you need fat to absorb the nutrients in your food, but there is also the taste factor.\nTherefore, ditch the fat-free salad dressing and try making your own at home.\nKey Point: Ignore conventional (and illogical) advice to use low-fat dressings on salad.\nOn a similar theme, if you want to make a dipping sauce then sour cream provides a great base.\nKey Point: Sour cream is versatile and works well in a range of recipes.\nWith 22.5g fat and only 5.3g carbohydrate per half-cup serving, sour cream is a healthy and perfectly viable food for low carb and ketogenic diets.\nSour cream also makes a great combination with many different low carb foods.\nKey Point: Sour cream is extremely low in dietary carbohydrate and is very high in fat.\nA keto and low carb recipe that combines twice-cooked cabbage, bacon, sour cream and cheese.\nA keto blue-cheese dressing that is ideal for a salad and also works as a dipping sauce.\nIt is a low-carb version of Mexican food and combines beef, oil, seasonings, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, avocado, salt and sour cream.\nOver recent years, more and more studies appear to support dairy fat as heart-protective.\nDespite this, it seems that fermented dairy such as cheese and sour cream takes it one step further regarding benefits.\nKey Point: Fermented dairy foods such as sour cream appear to have even better benefits than non-fermented dairy products.\nSimilar to all dairy products, sour cream provides a significant amount of calcium.\nIn combination with vital co-factors such as magnesium, vitamin D and vitamin K, calcium plays a major role in bone density and protecting against tooth decay (17, 18).\nKey Point: Sour cream provides a large amount of dietary calcium.\nAs calcium deficiency is quite common, dairy foods are an important source of the mineral.\nSour cream is a delicious high-fat dairy food that is full of beneficial nutrients.","2":"Reduced fat sour cream has a similar nutrient profile but with fewer calories and about 38% less fat (2Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, fat-free sour cream is made with skim milk and additives like food starch and gums so that it maintains a creamy consistency.\nIts lack of fat reduces the calorie count by about 60% compared with regular, though it may have slightly more carbs depending on the brand (3Trusted Source).\nBecause sour cream is primarily a garnish, it isn\u2019t typically eaten in the same volume as other dairy products like yogurt or milk.\nPlus, since other dairy products are made with all milk components \u2014 not just the cream \u2014 they provide significantly more protein, carbs, vitamins, and minerals than regular sour cream.\nSour cream isn\u2019t a significant source of nutrients in most diets, as it\u2019s eaten in such small quantities.\nFat-soluble vitamins are found in a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, but not all of them provide fat on their own.\nSour cream is traditionally made by fermenting dairy cream with lactic acid bacteria, which are one of the most common probiotics in food production.\nThus, certain types of sour cream may offer probiotic benefits (6Trusted Source).\nThus, many people may be pleased to know that regular sour cream is compliant with a variety of low carb diets, including keto and Atkins.\nSour cream may help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins, and some types harbor probiotics to boost your digestion and immune health.\nIn fact, about half of the calories in regular sour cream come from saturated fat.\nMoreover, evidence suggests that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated ones from foods like nuts, seeds, olives, and fish may reduce your risk of heart disease (7Trusted Source).\nThe American Heart Association recommends limiting your intake of saturated fat to 5\u20136% of your daily calories, or about 11\u201313 grams for someone who follows a 2,000-calorie diet (8).\nThere\u2019s plenty of room within these guidelines to eat sour cream, but it\u2019s still a good idea to limit your intake and vary the sources and types of fat in your diet.\nSour cream is high in saturated fat and should only be eaten in moderation.\nA 2016 review of 27 studies associated 2\u20134 daily servings of dairy as part of a calorie-restricted diet with greater total weight and fat loss than diets with little or no dairy (6Trusted Source).\nBecause sour cream is a calorie-dense food, it may be easy to eat too much.\nWhile dairy intake is tied to weight loss, keep in mind that sour cream is high in calories.\nIn some cases, it may even help you eat more nutrient-dense foods like veggies and legumes.\nThis dairy product may boost your absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and some types even pack probiotics.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s high in saturated fat and calories.\nYou can include it as part of a balanced diet, but be sure to eat it in moderation alongside a variety of whole foods to support optimal health.\nHere are the 7 best substitutes for sour cream, including vegan\u2026 This article examines the health effects of dairy products, which seem to vary greatly between individuals.\nHere are 15 healthy dips\u2026 Many dairy products are off-limits on the very low carb, high fat keto diet."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.verywellfit.com\/sour-cream-nutrition-facts-and-health-benefits-4843572","1":"onketosis.com\/sour-cream-nutrition-facts-and-8-impressive-health-benefits\/","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/is-sour-cream-healthy"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
