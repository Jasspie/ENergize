total, 21 types of fruit and 46 fresh and processed products produced in the UK and abroad are considered to estimate the impacts at both the product and the national levels.\nProcessing leads to high

whole UK fruit sector generates 7.9\u202fMt CO2 eq.\nOranges, bananas and apples are responsible for more than half of the impacts at the national level as they account for 64% of the total fruit

advice to \u2018eat seasonal\u2019 to help reduce our environmental footprint, but how much does seasonality affect the environmental footprint of the fruit and vegetables we eat?\nThis technique helps us measure and understand the impact of foods on the environment throughout the stages of the supply chain; from growing, harvesting, storing, transporting, all the way to consumption (figure 2).\nHowever, it is important to remember that GHG emissions are only one side of a complicated story about environmental impact and the sustainability of food production.\nIn general, fruit and vegetables have lower GHG emissions compared to animal products such as beef and dairy, in fact as much as 10-50 times lower.1 Figure 2.\nWhile the type of transportation might be significant for some fruit and vegetables, such as with air-freighted produce (e.g. berries, tropical fruit and green beans),\u00a0 the contribution of transportation to the carbon footprint is usually lower than the emissions coming from the methods of production.1 While climate-controlled greenhouses can mean less land used, less food wasted, lower pesticides and high yields, the energy needed to heat these buildings is significant.\nThe carbon footprint of tomatoes in season in Spain is lower because greenhouses require a lot of energy and by doing so, they emit GHG emissions.\nThis is because as the storage time in refrigerators increases, the amount of energy needed increases as well, thereby emitting more GHG emissions.6 The overall picture that emerges from research, is that the fruit and vegetables with the lowest GHG emissions are those that are grown outside during their natural season without much use of additional energy and consumed in the same country or region.\nThese have environmental benefits because they use less energy for artificial heating or lighting, for refrigeration and storage and avoid losses during storage, which generally helps to produce less GHG emissions, compared to fruit and vegetables that are grown under protection, are imported or stored.4,5 Check out examples of seasonal and local fruit and vegetables in countries around Europe.\nHowever, choosing locally produced and in season fruit and vegetables is just one aspect of eating more sustainably.\nWhile local and seasonal produce may have lower environmental impacts, global seasonality has helped not only expand global food markets but perhaps more importantly helped to provide a more varied and consistent supply of fruit and vegetables all year round, helping to increase the diversity of your diet and making sure you get a good balance of micronutrients throughout the year, especially for if you live in a country that has limited production seasons.4 It is not always clear where the fruit or vegetable you pick up in the market comes from.\nTips for choosing less GHG intensive fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables that are grown outside during their natural season and consumed in the same country generally have the lowest GHGs and are considered more environmentally friendly.\nWhile eating more seasonal and local fruit and vegetables will lead to some environmental benefits, it is just one part of a sustainable diet.\nOther strategies such as reducing consumption of animal-based products and reducing food waste are also essential parts of a healthy, sustainable diet.","2":"Using a life cycle approach, this work estimates for the first time the impacts of fruits consumed in the UK.\nIn total, 21 types of fruit and 46 fresh and

other fruits, prunes appear to be the most effective at preventing and reversing bone loss (22Trusted Source).\nPrunes have several properties that may benefit bone health by preventing or reversing bone loss, which may reduce the risk of conditions like osteoporosis.\nThey have been studied for their potential to reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which are major risk factors for heart disease.\nThose who consumed the prunes and prune juice had significantly lower blood pressure levels, total cholesterol and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol than the group that drank water (30Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that men who had been diagnosed with high cholesterol had lower LDL cholesterol levels after consuming 12 prunes daily for eight weeks (31Trusted Source).\nThe positive effects plums and prunes appear to have on heart disease risk factors are likely due to their high content of fiber, potassium and antioxidants (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nWhile the results of these studies are promising, keep in mind that more human research is needed to support the heart-protective effects of plums and prunes.\nPlums and prunes may promote heart health due to their potential role in lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nBoth plums and prunes are an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.","1":"A person can eat plums
