Then the beans are blanched for a few minutes before being sealed in cans and then cooked and sterilized in a retort\u2014a machine that\u2019s essentially a big, steam-powered pressure cooker.\n(That\u2019s about as much energy as it takes to drive a car one-quarter of a mile.) Since kidneys and pintos are tougher and take longer to cook\u2014about 75 percent longer than green beans, according to Truitt Brothers, the cannerythat commissioned the study\u2014processing them would require more energy.\nThen there\u2019s the excellent point you raised in your question: Getting those canned beans from the production facility to your local Piggly Wiggly is indeed going to require more fuel.\nBeans, when cooked, get 150 percent heavier\u00a0because of\u00a0water absorption.\nIn the green-bean study, for example, getting the cans to the customer accounted for only 8 percent of their overall greenhouse gas emissions.\nBased on some recorded energy figures provided by food researchers at the University of Bristol, cooking five ounces of beans for that long might require 1,400 to 5,600 BTUs on a gas stovetop or 4,100 to 16,500 BTUs on an electric stovetop, though everything from the amount of water to the kind of pot used could alter those numbers.\nThe numbers above assume that the electricity is coming from a coal-fired plant, but as the Lantern has often noted in the past, the fuel mix in your area may be cleaner.) On the high end, that\u2019s a lot more energy than the industrial cookers use\u2014even if we assumed that canning dry beans was twice as energy-intensive as canning green beans, cooking those beans on the stove would take up to 11 times as much energy as at a commercial facility."},"environment_urls":{"0":"theconversation.com\/green-beans-why-pulses-are-the-eco-friendly-option-for-feeding-and-saving-the-world-64014","1":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969719319758","2":"slate.com\/technology\/2009\/06\/the-greenest-way-to-buy-your-beans.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

year-round, meaning you\u2019ll find them in grocery stores no matter what season it is.\nWhile they may be low in calories, green beans contain many important nutrients that provide several health benefits.\nThese antioxidants fight free radicals in the body, which helps to reduce cell damage and may help to lower your risk of certain health conditions.\nGreen beans are full of fiber, which is an important nutrient for many reasons.\nThe fiber in green beans helps to keep your digestive system healthy and running smoothly.\nIf you have a digestive disorder like irritable bowel syndrome, however, certain types of fiber can do more harm than good, leaving you with gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort.\nGreen beans are a low FODMAP food, which can help to improve symptoms of

happy about all the good green beans nutrition does for your health.\nFrom helping prevent many types of disease\u00a0to supporting the health of your digestive system, green beans nutrition is a dynamic fighter to add to your healing diet\u00a0because green beans are some of the best high-antioxidant foods on the planet.\nIn addition to the\u00a0incredible nutrient content that you may recognize from a typical nutrition Facts list, green beans nutrition also contains high levels of several proteins, carotenoids and other antioxidants that make it a veritable mine of nutrition.\nOne of the\u00a0most heavily researched benefits is in the\u00a0ability of green beans nutrition to help prevent and stop the spread of several cancers throughout the body.\nWhile one of the reasons for this is the high antioxidant load in green beans nutrition, which help scavenge free radicals in the body responsible for many diseases, one overview study that compiled decades of research on the health benefits of green beans (and other varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris beans) found that:\u00a0\u201cThe anticarcinogenic activity of beans is related to the presence of resistant starch, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, as well as other microconstituents such as phytic acid, protease inhibitors, and saponins.\u201d (3) Basically, this refers to the fact that nutrients present in green beans help exert anticarcinogenic properties in the body, independently from the antioxidant activity found from green beans nutrition.\nResearch also supports that in addition to preventative measures, peptides in green beans can also slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.\n(5) Eating varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris is also associated with slowed or inhibited growth of leukemia, breast cancer and lymphoma cells.\nIt\u2019s suggested that people who consume high quantities of dietary lutein have a lowered risk of breast, colon, cervical and lung cancer, and green beans is No. 8\u00a0on the list of foods highest in lutein.\nMany health practitioners also use vitamin C to supplement chemotherapy drugs, as the vitamin helps the drugs target only the cancerous cells, rather than the entire body.\nHIV\/AIDS is associated with a number of health risks because it attacks T cells that normally help your body fight off infection.\nThe study from Hong Kong found that the green beans nutrition from French green beans significantly inhibited reverse transcription in HIV-1 cells, the more common form of HIV found throughout the world.\nThese findings suggest that green beans, along with antiretroviral therapy and other HIV\/AIDS-fighting foods like spirulina, may be a long-term treatment solution for patients suffering from these viruses.\n(6) When you consume whole-grain foods, such as beans and other legumes, three or more times in one week, you can decrease your risk of diabetes up to 35 percent.\nOther risk reduction methods for this disease include consuming foods with a low glycemic index.\nDue to\u00a0of the type of dietary fiber and carbohydrates found in green beans nutrition, these veggies are considered a low glycemic index\u00a0food because the carbohydrates release slowly in your system and help avoid spikes and dips in glucose levels in your blood.\nBeans are among the best whole-grain foods to eat, especially if you\u2019re monitoring your glucose levels and are already at risk for obesity or diabetes, because other popular whole-grain foods like baked potatoes and rice often have a high glycemic index, usually somewhere between 50 and 85, whereas beans score a low 20 on the scale.\nNot only do foods like green beans affect your potential risk of diabetes, but if you already have diabetes, your diet is crucial to managing this chronic condition.\nLow glycemic index diets are strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and regulate the diet-insulin responses of people with diabetes and prediabetes, and can also help your body properly process insulin.\nIn fact, hypoglycemic foods, including Phaseolus vulgaris, have been shown to decrease the glucose tolerance curve (a measurement tool used by physicians and researchers to observe the progression of glucose intolerance) by almost 5 percent more than the most commonly prescribed drug for diabetes.\nTheir findings show that various Phaseolus vulgaris beans, including green beans, can be used as one way to nutritionally control diabetes.\n(8) Other studies focus on the inflammation associated with diabetes and have found species of Phaseolus vulgaris beans play a key role in reducing this inflammation.\n(9) As I just mentioned, green beans are an excellent food for managing glucose levels in people at risk for obesity because they\u2019re a whole grain that scores very low on the glycemic index scale.\nAdding green beans to a balanced meal is clinically proven to help you lose weight by reducing your blood glucose levels, making you feel full and slowing the secretion of the hunger hormone, ghrelin, that causes your brain to desire to eat again.\nBeans help support heart health by managing metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions associated with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\nAgain, this can be explained in part by the resistant starch and dietary fiber content of beans, because they delay the use of glucose from foods, change the way your body uses fat and increase\u00a0satiety (the satisfied feeling you have after eating) to control the appetite.\nConsuming legumes four times or more a week can decrease the risk of heart disease up to 22 percent versus eating them once a week.\nSimilarly to their mechanism for helping maintain healthy eating and treating diabetes, this is because legumes like green beans are whole-grain, high-fiber foods that score low on the glycemic index scale.\n(11) Another study found an inverse association between legume consumption and coronary heart disease, discovering that eating just \u00be cup of beans daily decreased the risk of heart attack by an astounding 38 percent.\nGetting enough vitamin K in your diet helps protect the lining of your arteries and other body tissues, as well as reduces inflammation to maintain healthy blood pressure and reduces your risk of heart attack.\nLow levels of lutein are also associated with hardening of the artery walls, and high lutein in the bloodstream is connected with a reduced risk of coronary disease and heart attack, although the reasons why are still unclear.\nGreen beans and other legumes are excellent sources of nutrition for those at risk for infertility, as they\u2019re low on the glycemic index and also contain significant levels of folate and iron, three factors specifically indicated in nutrition-based research on improving fertility and beating infertility.\nThe fiber in green beans also helps your digestive system maintain optimal health, as it prevents many digestive problems.\nThat protection, combined with a regular dietary intake of vitamin B12 and vitamin C, helps your body absorb iron (also found in green beans nutrition), which also impacts digestive health.\n(17) Because of its high vitamin K content, green beans nutrition can also help your body build and maintain strong bones.\nWhile they have many benefits, there are a few cautions to consider when eating green beans regularly, one being the presence of oxalic acid (common in many green vegetables).\nAlways drink plenty of water to help reduce your risk, and consult your doctor if you have a history of oxalate urinary tract stones before consuming large amounts of green beans."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/health\/food-nutrition\/green-beans","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-green-beans","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/green-beans-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
