fourth installment of the Southeast Farm Press \u2018Peanut: It\u2019s Sustainable\u2019 series sponsored by AMVAC\/Thimet, we\u2019ll introduce you to a study that measures peanut butter\u2019s impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and introduce you to the country\u2019s most-recent and largest peanut shelling facility\u2019s efforts to create a program to connect its farmers\u2019 sustainable practices to its buyers.\nRelated: Peanut farmers asked to comment on rule revising Seg. 1 standards For a glimpse at peanut\u2019s post-harvest environmental impact, Marshall Lamb, research director of the National Peanut Lab, pointed Southeast Farm Press to an industry study very academically titled \u201cLife Cycle Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Associated with Production and Consumption of Peanut Butter in the U.S.\u201d The study was published by the American The detailed study looks at the supply chain of peanut butter and breaks down the chain into six sub-systems in the process: the farm, to the buying point, to the sheller, to the processor, to retail and finally to the consumer.\nIt measures how much CO2e of each sub-system in the chain is created to make, deliver and consumer 1kg, or 2.2 pounds, of peanut butter.\nThis would be accomplished by quantifying GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions associated with the production, consumption, and disposal of peanut butter in the U.S.\u201d In short, from \u2018cradle to grave\u2019 as the study puts it, \u201c1 kg (or 2.2 pounds) of peanut butter contributes an average of 2.88 kg CO2e to global (greenhouse gas emission) impacts.\u201d Of the 2.88 kg CO2e created by 2.2 pounds of peanut butter consumption, the processor, retail and consumer sub-systems contribute 2.4 kg CO2e.\nThe farm sub-system (or what it takes to grow the peanut) creates .4 kg CO2e per 2.2 pounds of peanut butter consumed.\nTwo months ago, Shannon Parrish was hired by the farmer-owned company to be its supply chain sustainability coordinator and to develop a program to help its 260 or so farmers understand what sustainability means and to show that many production practices they implement are already considered sustainable but possibly can be improved.\nBut most importantly to the company, also show its growers how sustainable practices can make them more profitable and at the same time make the company\u2019s product more appealing to their buyers and to the growing number of consumers who care about where and how their food is created."},"environment_urls":{"0":"thesustainabilityalliance.us\/u-s-peanuts-fact-sheet\/","1":"www.peanutsusa.com\/ipf-presentations.html?download=854:fri-02-james-mccarty-peanut-sustainability","2":"www.farmprogress.com\/peanut\/peanut-s-environmental-footprint-stretches-beyond-farm"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

rich in protein, fat, and various healthy nutrients.\nStudies show that peanuts may even be useful for weight loss and are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.\nHere are the nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw peanuts: Peanuts are packed with healthy fats and high-quality protein.\nPeanuts are high in fat, consisting mostly of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\nPeanuts are a good source of protein.\nThe protein content ranges from 22\u201330% of its total calories, making peanuts a great source of plant-based protein (1, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThe most abundant proteins in peanuts, arachin and conarachin, can be severely allergenic to some people, causing life-threatening reactions (5Trusted Source).\nFor a plant food, peanuts are an exceptionally good source of protein.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Peanuts are an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals.\nDespite being high in fat and calories, peanuts do not appear to contribute to weight gain (21Trusted Source).\nIn fact, observational studies have shown that peanut consumption may help maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of obesity (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nHowever, one small, 6-month study in healthy women suggested that when other sources of fat in a low-fat diet were replaced with peanuts, they lost 6.6 pounds (3 kg) despite being told to maintain their initial weight (26Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that when 3 ounces (89 grams) of peanuts were added to the daily diet of healthy adults for 8 weeks, they did not gain as much weight as expected (27Trusted Source).\nPeanuts are very filling and can be considered an effective component of a weight loss diet.\nIn addition to being a weight-loss-friendly food, peanuts are associated with several other health benefits.\nObservational studies indicate that eating peanuts, as well as other types of nuts, may protect against heart disease (25Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nNotably, peanuts contain a number of heart-healthy nutrients.\nTwo observational studies suggest that frequent peanut consumption may cut the risk of gallstones in both men and women (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nAs most gallstones are largely composed of cholesterol, the cholesterol-lowering effect of peanuts may be the cause (40Trusted Source).\nAs a source of many heart-healthy nutrients, peanuts may help prevent heart disease.\nAflatoxin contamination can be effectively prevented by properly drying peanuts after harvesting and keeping temperature and humidity low during storage (41Trusted Source).\nIn peanuts, it ranges from 0.2\u20134.5% (42Trusted Source).\nPhytic acid reduces the availability of iron and zinc in peanuts, lowering their nutritional value slightly (19Trusted Source).\nAllergy to peanuts is estimated to affect approximately 1% of Americans (43Trusted Source).\nPeanut allergies are potentially life-threatening, and peanuts are sometimes considered the most severe allergen (44Trusted Source).\nThere are several downsides to peanuts, including potential aflatoxin contamination, phytic acid content, and severe allergic reactions.\nThey can be useful as a part of a weight loss diet and may reduce your risk of both heart disease and gallstones.\nPeanut butter is fairly nutritious and is a good source of protein compared to many other plant foods.\nWhile peanut butter is tasty and nutrient-dense, you may wonder whether it\u2019s appropriate for weight loss.","2":"The peanut plant likely originated in South America in Brazil or Peru.\nMany people believe the peanut is not as nutritionally valuable as true nuts like almonds, walnuts, or cashews.\nBut actually, peanuts have many of the same health benefits as the more expensive nuts and should not be overlooked as a nutritious food.\nBut research suggests that peanuts are every bit as good for heart health as more expensive nuts.\nPeanuts help prevent heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels.\nAnd among nuts, peanuts are second only to almonds when it comes to protein count.\nEating peanuts might help you live longer too.\nA large-scale study found that people who regularly ate any kind of nuts (including peanuts) were less likely to die of any cause than were people who rarely ate nuts.\nBecause the study was observational, it cannot prove that peanuts were exactly what caused the lower death rates, but they are definitely associated with them.\nPeanuts are a low-glycemic food, which means that eating them won\u2019t cause a spike in your blood sugar levels.\nStudies have shown that eating peanuts can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.\nResearch has demonstrated that for older people, eating peanut butter may help lower the risk of developing a certain type of stomach cancer called gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma.\nWhile peanuts may have a large amount of fat, most of the fats they contain are known as \u201cgood fats.\u201d These kinds of fats actually help lower your cholesterol levels.\n\u25cf Add peanut butter to
