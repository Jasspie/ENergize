Official Website","2":""},"environment_summaries":{"0":"While climate change may affect waterfowl directly (e.g., by altering timing of migration), more serious impacts could occur through effects on habitat.\nProjections for the next 100 years indicate warming in most areas, changing patterns of precipitation, accelerating sea-level rise, declining snowpacks, and increasing frequency and intensity of severe weather.\nConsequences for waterfowl habitat could include changes in the timing and duration of when wetlands are wet, changes in land use, northward expansion of invasive species, and greater challenges for water management.\nNext in importance are the continent's key waterfowl wintering areas: the Central Valley of California, Gulf Coast, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley.\nIn the Prairie Pothole Region, for example, average temperatures have increased over the past century, and all global climate models predict further warming and a reduction in average soil moisture in this region.\nAgricultural practices such as grazing and haying that leave grassland intact provide habitat for nesting waterfowl and other wildlife, and conserve accumulated carbon in prairie soils.\nAgricultural experts are divided about how prairie agriculture will change in the decades ahead, but one recent analysis by Agriculture Canada suggests that new areas of Alberta and Saskatchewan may become suitable for small-grain production in the future, which would be a negative development for waterfowl habitat.\nThe biggest obstacle in predicting impacts of climate change on boreal waterfowl is our meager understanding of the basic ecology of boreal wetlands.\nThis is a serious knowledge gap because while several boreal duck species (scaup, scoters, and wigeon) are declining, resource development is expanding and northern climate is changing.\nLess sediment is available to build new wetland habitat, so coastal marshes are unable to keep pace with sea-level rise.\nRefuges, duck clubs, state wetlands, and rice fields all depend on allocations of California's managed water.\nIf rice production declines (because of rising irrigation costs, for example), then winter flooding of agricultural land would be of little value to waterfowl.\nFuture impacts of climate change are less certain in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.\nPresently, however, climate models offer contrasting predictions about future river flows, leaving us with little ability to predict flooding patterns.\nGlobal climate change poses difficult challenges for conservation planners because of the scale and complexity of the problem, the long time required to learn about impacts, and the uncertainty associated with predictions about future conditions.\nIn the long run, reducing greenhouse gas emissions seems prudent for reducing losses of waterfowl habitat, and DU is taking steps to assess and improve its own carbon \"balance sheet.\" We must also consider strategies to help species and ecosystems cope with changes that are inevitable.\nWaterfowl habitats almost everywhere have been affected by human development, so any effects of climate change will be imposed on top of existing pressures.\nReducing existing stresses on wetlands (e.g., nutrient loading, toxic chemicals, filling, drainage, soil erosion, urban encroachment) and associated uplands (e.g., overgrazing, intensive tillage) should reduce vulnerability to climate-induced changes and may be the single most achievable thing that we can do today to help prepare for a warmer but uncertain future.\nRestoring or protecting complexes of wetlands of varying permanence and striving to restore habitats across a wide geographic area may help hedge against variable moisture conditions.\nFor instance, coordinated planning for the provision of wintering habitat in the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast regions seems prudent and is under way by conservation partners in these regions.\nDU will also support efforts by the national wildlife refuge system and by neighboring states and provinces to cope with species' range shifts and changes to waterfowl habitat.\nIn this way, efforts to restore rivers and floodplain habitats in the Midwest can benefit coastal wetlands by restoring historic river flooding and sedimentation downstream.\nThe public may support added wetland restoration efforts where multiple benefits of nutrient reduction in water, flood abatement, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat can be realized simultaneously.\nAt the state\/provincial, federal, and international levels, DU's science is already informing public policy discussions that seek to protect the ability of grasslands, wetlands, and other natural systems to absorb and store carbon, and that support market-based tools for conservation of environmental goods and services.\nOne specific challenge for waterfowl and wetland managers is that climate models were built to work at large geographic scales.\nIn Louisiana, water-management plans that better resemble historical processes that rebuild Mississippi Delta wetlands are needed.\nThey will be good for wetland conservation and inform future management choices whatever the extent of climate change.","1":"","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.ducks.org\/Conservation\/Public-Policy\/Climate-Change-and-Waterfowl\/Ducks-in-a-Changing-Climate","1":"www.nrhtx.com\/680\/Ducks-and-the-Environment","2":"www.dpi.nsw.gov.au\/__data\/assets\/pdf_file\/0009\/442854\/introduction-to-commercial-duck-farming.pdf"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

(and Full Nutrition Facts)"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Most cooking methods involve preparing the duck so that the majority of the fat is rendered off, leaving crispy skin and lean meat.\nThe rendered duck fat can be used as a healthier alternative to butter or other animal fats used in cooking.\nIt's an excellent source of protein and healthy fat as well as micronutrients including selenium, iron, and niacin.\nDuck eggs are also nutrient dense with a similar nutrient profile to chicken eggs (with higher amounts per egg because duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs.) This nutrition information, for one 3-ounce (85g) roasted skinless Pekin duck breast, is provided by the USDA.1\ufeff The Pekin breed is the most commonly consumed type of duck in the U.S. Duck alone does not contain any carbohydrates (which means it does not have any fiber or sugar).\nHowever, the amount of overall fat content will vary significantly based on whether or not duck is cooked and consumed with or without the skin.\nIn fact, without skin and visible fat, duck meat has\u00a0less fat than roasted skinless chicken breasts.\nFor example, skinless duck breast provides only 2g total fat (0.5g of which is saturated fat) per 3-ounce portion.\nThe same portion of roasted skinless chicken breast provides 3g total fat (1g of which is saturated fat).\nAs with chicken, duck legs and thighs have slightly more total fat (a 3-ounce portion of skinless duck legs contains 5g total fat), but duck legs still contain less fat than skinless chicken thighs.2\ufeff Moreover, the majority of the fat is healthy unsaturated fat, including a high amount of monounsaturated fat and a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.\nEven if consumed with skin, the fat content of duck will vary depending on how much fat was rendered off during the cooking process.\nDuck meat provides\u00a0high-quality protein with a variety of non-essential and essential amino acids.\nDuck is an animal protein that provides some of the beneficial nutrients common in red meat (such as iron), without as much saturated fat as red meat.\nConsuming an adequate amount of selenium is also important for thyroid health.3\ufeff A 3-ounce portion of Pekin duck meat provides over 50% of the daily value for selenium.\nSome research shows that consuming animal protein, including duck, may improve bone density and strength\u2014as long as calcium intake is also sufficient.4\ufeff While oily fish is considered a top source of omega-3 fatty acids, duck also contains these\u00a0heart-healthy acids.\nEating duck (and other forms of poultry) in place of steak and other meats high in saturated fat also has the potential for some positive health outcomes related to the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nPlus, duck provides about as much iron as red meat, significantly more than you get from chicken.\nThis is so residues can exit the bird's system.\"5\ufeff While many chefs prefer to serve duck medium-rare, the USDA recommends cooking duck to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, as you would with any poultry.5\ufeff If you render duck fat, strain it through a cheesecloth to filter out any particles that may have come off of the meat.\nTo prepare duck breasts, start by rendering the fat and crisping up the skin.\nDuck, young duckling, domesticated, White Pekin, breast, meat

duck is all the nutrients that come from the meat.\nDuck has proven to be an excellent source of iron, which is essential in the production of hemoglobin, a base part of red blood cells.\nMany proteins that play important roles in keeping your body running are also found in duck meat.\nDuck meat is a great source of a number of vitamin B compounds, especially B-12.\nFinally, duck meat is a source of glycine.\nThe biggest knock many people have against duck meat is the elevated fat content.\nIndeed, duck has been found to have particularly high levels of saturated fat, especially in comparison to other poultry dishes.\nIf you remove the skin before cooking it, duck actually has about the same fat content as meat from other birds.\nBecause of these concerns, many nutritionists often recommend treating duck as a dish for special occasions and not as a full-time substitute for other healthier meats.\nWhen you\u2019re preparing a meal made with duck meat, it\u2019s important to be sure the meat is cooked all the way through before consuming it, just as with other meat that comes from birds.\nMany popular dishes throughout the world make use of duck meat.\nOriginally found in China during the Ming Dynasty, Peking duck is a specialty dish renowned the world over.\nAnother popular meal made with duck meat is foie gras.\nDuck fat also comes with many nutrition facts and health benefits.\nTo produce duck fat, you simply have to collect the fat that renders while you\u2019re cooking the meat.\nThough there are disagreements about the specific health benefits of using duck fat in your cooking, some nutritionists believe it can help reduce \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, increase energy levels, and lower blood glucose levels.\nThere are many places to find the duck meat that will make your next meal special.","2":"This article examines the nutrition profile, benefits, and potential negatives of duck meat.\nHowever, nations around the world consume a wide range of roasted and steamed duck dishes.\nGenerally, duck meat has a higher fat content than other poultry such as chicken and turkey, and the meat is darker in color.\nDuck meat has a much stronger flavor than both chicken and turkey.\nThe following data tables show the full nutritional values for duck meat per 100 grams (4).\nAs shown in the table, duck offers a moderate amount of protein and a relatively\u00a0higher fat content compared to other meats.\nSelenium is the most concentrated mineral in duck, and the meat is high in phosphorus, iron, zinc,\u00a0and copper.\nMost of the health benefits of duck meat relate to the protein and nutrients it contains.\nGlycine is an important amino acid that plays a wide range of roles within the body, and duck offers 1614 mg per 100 grams (4).\nPer 100 grams, duck (including the skin) offers 19 grams of protein.\nHowever, just the pure duck meat without skin provides an even more significant amount, supplying 23.5 grams per 100 g (12).\nThe primary mineral in duck meat is selenium, and this mineral offers a lot nutritionally.\nDuck provides 29% of the RDI for selenium per 100 grams.\nWhile duck is a healthy food that contains a variety of health-promoting compounds, there is one potential drawback to be aware of; contamination.\nHowever, one study found that duck species living in aquatic systems near to areas of environmental pollution showed excessively high levels of mercury and selenium.\nAs a result, tests on duck meat regularly find mercury contamination levels that can exceed the amounts in high-mercury seafood (22).\nSince many people are unsure how to cook duck, here are\u00a0two delicious recipe ideas; one for roasting and one for steaming.\nDuck is a nutritious meat that offers several beneficial nutrients and a great taste."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.verywellfit.com\/duck-nutrition-facts-4770569","1":"vincentsmeatmarket.com\/2020\/11\/16\/nutrition-facts-and-health-benefits-of-duck\/","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/duck-meat-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
