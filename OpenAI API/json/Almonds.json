Alliance"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"California grows close to 100% of commercial almonds in the U.S. and 81% of almonds worldwide.\nIf you Google \u201care almonds environmentally friendly,\u201d you\u2019ll see results about why you \u201cshould ditch the almond milk,\u201d \u201cthe dark side of almond use,\u201d \u201care you nuts to keep eating almonds?\u201d and other similar headlines.\nBut how much water do almonds actually use?\nA single almond takes about 1.1 gallons of water to produce.\nCalifornia dedicates about 8% of its total agricultural water supply to growing almonds.\nAlmond trees need water year-round, even when they\u2019re not producing almonds.\nAnd more almond trees are being planted in California, with the number of almond orchards doubling in the last 20 years.\nThe water almonds need became a topic of concern during the California drought from 2012 to 2016, the worst one on record since 1895.\nThe authors compared the nutrition content of 42 different California food crops.\nThey concluded that for the water needed to produce them, almonds ranked among the most valuable foods grown in California for their dietary and economic benefits.\nIn fact, almonds ranked at or near the top of all California crops in seven of the 11 nutrient categories.\nAnd walnuts and pistachios ranked similar to almonds for their water use.\nSo, yes, California produces a lot of almonds.\nBut the state is a leading producer of another product that uses even more water\u2026 and that\u2019s dairy.\nSo, if each almond takes about 1.1 gallons of water to grow, then it takes about 84 gallons of water to produce the almonds used in a typical store-bought gallon of almond milk.\nBy comparison, it can take up to 880 gallons of water to produce a gallon of dairy milk.\nPlant-based milks not only typically need less water than dairy, but they also have a smaller carbon footprint.\nAlmonds are estimated to have a carbon footprint 10 times smaller than that of dairy milk.\nAnd both dairy and beef cows use a huge amount of water.\nAround one-third of the state\u2019s entire water budget is used to produce meat and dairy.\nStunningly, California\u2019s livestock industry uses more water than all the homes, businesses, and government in the state combined.\nAlfalfa consumes the most water of any crop in California.\nCalifornia, it turns out, exports more than 100 billion gallons of water per year in the form of alfalfa to countries like China, who use it for livestock feed.\nIn response to the recent drought, the state\u2019s almond farmers have been working to improve their water efficiency.\nAnd progress is being made: California almond farmers have reduced the amount of water it takes to grow one pound of almonds by 33% over 20 years.\nAnd by 2025, the California almond community commits to reduce the amount of water to grow a pound of almonds by an additional 20%.\nNearly 80% of farmers across the state use efficient microirrigation systems, which conserve water by applying it where the crop needs it rather than to the entire field.\nAnd the Almond Board is exploring if almond orchards can help replenish underground aquifers (which are used for drinking water and agriculture).\nFor these nuts to grow, bees must pollinate each blossom.\nAlmond orchards are the first natural food source of the year for many bees after winter hibernation.\nAccording to the Almond Board of California, almond pollen is nutritious, providing all 10 of the essential amino acids bees need.\nMore than 70% of all commercial honey bee colonies in the United States are used to pollinate almond orchards.\nAnd many of the bees in California are dying from pesticides used on almond groves.\nUnfortunately, there are only a few million acres of almond groves that are currently certified organic in California.\nAs Ward Burroughs says in the video, \u201cYou cannot improve the health of this world if you\u2019re gonna continue to put poisons and toxins on it to produce your food.\u201d When purchasing almonds and almond milk, there are some good reasons to go organic if you can.\nCertified organic almonds are grown without pesticides, which makes them more bee-friendly.\nHomemade recipes call for a lot more almonds than store-bought varieties, so you can get more of their health benefits).","1":"Also, 99% of the total production of almonds comes from California.\nAs California is in a current drought, and the fact that almonds require 10% of California\u2019s total water supply each year, one could say that this statistic is astounding.\nThe effect of the amount of water required for almonds must be relatively compared, like all products.\nThis is exemplified by comparing the amount of water required to produce 1 gram of protein from almonds and beef.\nFor almonds, 1 gram of protein requires 4 gallons of water, while for 1 gram of beef; 27 gallons of water are needed.\nAs for water amount, it takes 6 times less the amount of water to produce protein out of almonds than it is from beef.\nI have always looked at almonds as a healthier option, but I never realized how much water it takes to produce them.\nFrom what you have highlighted, it seems that the extent to which California produces Almonds, proves unsustainable long term.\nAs soon as you compared it to how many loads of laundry you could do, I was really able to visualize how much water is actually being wasted to produce almond milk.\nWhile it is shocking to see the statistics behind the water needed to grow a single almond, I still wonder whether people will be willing to change their habits.","2":"Dr. Brodt showed how Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was increasingly being used by the food industry and policy makers as a comprehensive tool for measuring environmental sustainability in food production by using several crops as case studies, including California almonds.\nThe study, published in The Journal of Industrial Ecology[i], is the most exhaustive food life cycle assessment study to date by the university\u2019s researchers, and it demonstrates the complexity of agricultural systems and prospects for significant environmental benefits.\nThe Californian almond industry is being utilized as an important case study to highlight the potential for supply chain sustainability.\u201d  \u201cThe food industry and policy makers can use Life Cycle Assessments as a comprehensive tool for measuring environmental sustainability in food production and this is an area that requires ongoing research as environmental conditions and regulations change.\nThis is a key area of focus as updating the LCA modelling research is already underway with greater emphasis on the co-products and surface and groundwater usage.\u201d Current research from the California Almond Sustainability Program shows that 74 percent of almond growers use orchard prunings (tree wood, bark, clippings and other materials) for in-orchard chipping, composting, or energy generation.\n[i] Elias Marvinney,\u00a0Alissa Kendall,\u00a0Sonja Brodt, Weiyuan Zhu.
