Forum","1":"The Shocking Environmental Effects of Avocado Farming | Vox Nature","2":"Avocado consumption: environmental and social considerations - MSU Extension"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"Mexico produces more avocado than anywhere in the world, but the \u201cgreen gold\u201d, as it is known, is consumed mainly in North America, Europe and Asia.\nEach year, 11 billion pounds of avocado are consumed around the world.\nA few weeks ago, every six minutes, a truck full of avocados was leaving the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n for export to the USA in preparation for the most important date for avocado producers in the year: the Super Bowl, which sees 7% of the annual avocado consumption in only one day.\nExports were highly benefited by the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); by 2005, Mexican avocado was all over the supermarkets in the United States, currently the most important market in the planet for the fruit.\nDespite this massive creation of value and success, extensive avocado production has substantial and irretrievable environmental costs and damages.\nAround 9.5 billion litres of water are used daily to produce avocado \u2013 equivalent to 3,800 Olympic pools \u2013 requiring a massive extraction of water from Michoac\u00e1n aquifers.\nAs we develop multistakeholder capitalism, we urgently need to start thinking about the origin of our foods and to create more sustainable consumption food chains.\nAwareness of the environmental impact of what we consume is the first step to reducing the climate impact of our food.\nFirstly, we need to demand as consumers an international certification of sustainable farming and fair trade for the avocados sold in supermarkets and stores \u2013 to ensure they are not the product of deforestation, organized crime, or indiscriminate exploitation of aquifers.\nSecondly, trade agreements need to include the environmental impact in their clauses related to exports.\nMexico also needs to change its law to prevent and punish the burning of forest land for avocado production.\nTwo billion people in the world currently suffer from malnutrition and according to some estimates, we need 60% more food to feed the global population by 2050.\nYet the agricultural sector is ill-equipped to meet this demand: 700 million of its workers currently live in poverty, and it is already responsible for 70% of the world\u2019s water consumption and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nWith research, increasing investments in new agriculture technologies and the integration of local and regional initiatives aimed at enhancing food security, the platform is working with over 50 partner institutions and 1,000 leaders around the world to leverage emerging technologies to make our food systems more sustainable, inclusive and efficient.\nFinally, if any of this does not happen, we need to rethink our diet and lifestyle trends and reduce the consumption of avocado to minimise our personal contribution to the environmental impact caused by \u201cgreen gold\u201d.","1":"This never-ending demand for avocado is fueling avocado prices, which drives more and more farmers to avocado farming for the profit, regardless of its effects on the environment.\nConsequently, Mexican farmers are slowly clearing the pines to make way for this profitable fruit.\nIllegal thinning of pine trees is so rampant in the Michoac\u00e1n region of Mexico that estimates show a shocking 30 to 40 percent of the forest is lost annually to pave way for avocado farming.\nThe effects of this are obvious \u2013 rivers are running dry due to lack of adequate rainfall, wildlife and other organisms that are dependent on the forest are dying and becoming extinct, and drought is now becoming more pronounced than previous years.\nAn avocado plantation requires a substantial amount of water to produce in abundance, twice as much as a regular forest.\nOne report estimates that on average, you need approximately 75 gallons (283 liters) of water to produce about one pound (a half a kilogram) of avocado, which translates to about two to four medium-sized avocados.\nImagine how much water is needed to produce the millions that feed the world.\nUnlike natural forests, avocados require pesticides to survive the pests that consume these fruits.\nAnd to get a high-quality grade avocado fruit that will fetch money, farmers must use tons of pesticides to protect these avocado orchards.\nReports say that the cartel makes close to $150 million each year from \u2018avocado tax\u2019 and owns 10 percent of all the avocado farms in that area.\nHowever, the fact remains that avocados are seasonal fruits whose season starts in March and ends in late July in California.\nAlthough this may not apply due to people\u2019s love for avocados in their meals, more is required to limit the side effects of avocado farming.\nFor the sustainability of our planet, we need to find ways to benefit this planet, instead of stripping it off its nutrients and water source without giving something back in return.","2":"The health benefits gained from consuming these healthy fat alternatives is not limited to only anti-obesity results.\nBut like everything else in life, receiving a benefit comes at a cost- and I\u2019m not talking about the $1.95 extra we pay to have guacamole on our tacos.\nI\u2019m talking about the social and environmental costs of America\u2019s increasing obsession of wanting avocado all year round.\nIt\u2019s good to know when avocado season is in our own country because when you buy avocado at any other time you are more than likely buying avocado from another country, which means more greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and less support towards farmers in our own country.\nAs a result of the demand from the US for avocados, farmers in Mexico are influenced to increase the size of their farms, which is now leading to environmental issues including deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn our own country, a drought that started in 2012 and has lasted until a few months ago in California has led to avocado prices rising to an all-time high.\nAccording to several news sources, avocado growers and pickers in Mexico reported being extremely unhappy with the wages they receive, leading them to hold a workers strike and slowing down the supply of avocados into the U.S. Like many agricultural jobs, the workdays are long and hard, income is insufficient, child labor is common, and the job itself is insecure.\nClearly, the dollar amount we pay for avocados might seem high at face value, but knowing more about the health benefits, and the environmental and social costs of eating this fruit, will hopefully help put everything into perspective next time you decide to indulge yourself in this luxurious treat.\nIf you\u2019re looking for good fats to eat during the off season, eggs, walnuts and fish caught in Lake Superior (lake trout, salmon, whitefish), are among some alternatives to avocados that will not only help your health, but will also support local Michigan farmers.\nMichigan State University Extension promotes healthy eating, a variety of sources for nutritional balance, and the Michigan farmers and fishers that provide food in our state.\nGet news about Michigan State University

pear.\u201d It is loaded with healthy fats, fiber and various important nutrients.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving packs 14% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA), compared to 10% in bananas, which are a typical high-potassium food (5).\nSeveral studies show that having a high potassium intake is linked to reduced blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure (6Trusted Source).\nAvocados are very high in potassium, which should support healthy blood pressure levels.\nThe majority of the fat in avocado is oleic acid \u2014 a monounsaturated fatty acid that is also the major component of olive oil and believed to be responsible for some of its health benefits.\nAvocados and avocado oil are high in monounsaturated oleic acid, a heart-healthy fatty acid that is believed to be one of the main reasons for the health benefits of olive oil.\nIt\u2019s indigestible plant matter that can contribute to weight loss, reduce blood sugar spikes and is strongly linked to a lower risk of many diseases (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nSoluble fiber is known for feeding the friendly gut bacteria in your intestine, which are very important for optimal body function (14Trusted Source).\nAbout 25% of the fiber in avocado is soluble, while 75% is insoluble (15Trusted Source).\nAvocados tend to be rich in fiber \u2014 about 7% by weight, which is very high compared to most other foods.\nFiber may have important benefits for weight loss and metabolic health.\nOne of the studies found that including avocado in a low-fat, vegetarian diet significantly improved the cholesterol profile (24Trusted Source).\nThough their results are impressive, it\u2019s important to note that all of the human studies were small and short-term, including only 13\u201337 people with a duration of 1\u20134 weeks.\nNumerous studies have shown that eating avocado can improve heart disease risk factors like total, \u201cbad\u201d LDL and \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, as well as blood triglycerides.\nOne study looked at the dietary habits and health of people who eat avocados.\nThey had a much higher nutrient intake and were half as likely to have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that are a major risk factor for heart disease and diabetes (25Trusted Source).\nOne dietary survey found that people who ate avocados had a much higher nutrient intake and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome.\nOne study showed that adding avocado or avocado oil to either salad or salsa can increase antioxidant absorption 2.6- to 15-fold (26Trusted Source).\nSo, not only is avocado highly nutritious, it can dramatically increase the nutrient value of other plant foods that you are eating.\nThis is an excellent reason to always include a healthy fat source when you eat veggies.\nStudies have shown that eating avocado or avocado oil with vegetables can dramatically increase the number of antioxidants you take in.\nThis includes the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are incredibly important for eye health (27Trusted Source, 28).\nThese nutrients are very important for eye health and lower your risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.\nTest-tube studies suggest that it may help reduce side effects of chemotherapy in human lymphocytes (31Trusted Source).\nSome test-tube studies have shown that nutrients in avocados may have benefits in preventing prostate cancer and lowering side effects of chemotherapy.\nIn one study, people eating avocado with a meal felt 23% more satisfied and had a 28% lower desire to eat over the next 5 hours, compared to people who did not consume this fruit (35Trusted Source).\nAvocados are also high in fiber and very low in carbs, two attributes that should help promote weight loss as well, at least in the context of a healthy, real-food-based diet.\nThey\u2019re also high in fiber and low in carbs, which may promote weight loss.\nAvocados are not only healthy, they\u2019re also incredibly delicious and go with many types of food.","1":"What\u2019s more, they are nutritious, versatile, and may even help you lose weight.\nRead on to learn everything

chemicals\u201d) which may potentially provide health benefits, based on observational, test tube and animal studies.\nIn systematic reviews of randomized trials, fiber has been found to help lower blood sugar and LDL cholesterol.\nAdding a large avocado to a meal \u2014 or dividing it among two meals \u2014 is an easy and delicious way to get an impressive 14 grams of fiber.\nA growing number of high-quality studies demonstrate that low-carb diets can help people lose weight and achieve better type 2 diabetes control.\nIf you\u2019re cutting back on carbs, eating avocado can help you stay

recommend counting calories to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.\nInstead, we advise you to make your calories count by choosing nutritious, satisfying foods \u2014 like avocado.\nA 2013 trial showed that adding avocado to a meal helped participants feel full for several hours.\nRecent similar crossover trials have found that, because of its combo of fat and fiber,  including avocado at a meal triggers greater release of \u201cfullness\u201d hormones like PYY and GLP-1 that play a strong role in making people feel satisfied.\nAdding avocado slices to a burger and fries or eating guacamole with chips likely won\u2019t help you lose weight.\nBut including avocado as part of a healthy diet might be a good strategy for successful weight loss.\nAvocados are delicious, nutritious, exceptionally filling, and may provide some health benefits.\nMany people worry that they contain too many calories or are fattening, but as part of a healthy diet they may help with weight loss.\nGet

oval- to pear-shaped fruits are native to Central and South America, originally found in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala and the lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\nWhile varieties vary in size and skin color when ripe, they are all equally considered a heart-healthy superfood.\nAvocados are high in healthy monounsaturated fats like oleic acid , which is an omega-9 fatty acid.\nMonounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are heart-healthy fats.\nThey help to reduce inflammation, lower bad cholesterol, increase good cholesterol, and reduce risks for coronary heart disease and other chronic health issues.\nThe monounsaturated fats in avocados can help your body better absorb vitamins like A, D, E, and K.\nAvocados can even help your body get more nutritional
