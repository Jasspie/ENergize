tropical\u00a0South\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Asia, but they are among the most widely consumed foods in the world, and the most widely consumed fruit in the U.S. Bananas are a valuable food source during the\u00a0hunger season in many countries, as the crops produce fruit year-round.\nThis is particularly important in countries that do not import most of their food sources, and it also makes bananas critical to global\u00a0food security.\nTo keep bananas uniform-looking so that companies abroad will accept them, growers have to spray their plantations with\u00a0large amounts of pesticides, in fact much higher amounts than other tropical crops because of the banana\u2019s thick peel, which makes it more impervious than other fruits.\nThese might not harm the consumer, since we discard banana peels (or, hopefully, compost them), but the mass use of harmful pesticides impacts the health of workers and villagers surrounding growing areas.\nThey filed lawsuits against the companies involved with DBCP production and distribution, and DBCP is now no longer used on large-scale crops However, similar cases regarding prolonged pesticide use are still ongoing, and there is widespread concern amongst small scale growers and local residents for the health of young children especially, as well as over-reliance on harmful chemicals.\nIn 2007, Chiquita Brands International, Inc pled guilty to supporting a military rebel group in Columbia known as AUC.\nSmall-scale banana farmers have to compete with large corporations when selling the fruits of their labor.\nPrice competition in grocery stores in western states means lower prices for growers abroad, despite the fact that it is hard labor to maintain banana plantations and highly skilled word.\nLastly, being publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high-quality content.","2":"Climate change could negatively impact banana cultivation in some of the world's most important producing and exporting countries, a study has revealed.\nWhile many reports have looked at the impact of climate change on agricultural production, the effect rising temperatures and changing rainfall has on crucial tropical crops such as the banana are less well understood.\nIn a new study, led by Dr. Dan Bebber from the University of Exeter, scientists have studied both the recent and future impact of climate change on the world's leading banana producers and exporters.\nIt shows that 27 countries\u2014accounting for 86 per cent of the world's dessert banana production\u2014have on average seen increased crop yield since 1961 due to the changing climate resulting in more favourable growing conditions.\nIt suggests that 10 countries\u2014including the world's largest producer and consumer of banana India and the fourth largest producer, Brazil\u2014are predicted to see a significant decline in crop yields.\nIt showed that by 2050, any positive effects of climate change on average global banana yields, though likely to continue, will be significantly lessened."},"environment_urls":{"0":"community.plu.edu\/~bananas\/environmental\/home.html","1":"www.onegreenplanet.org\/animalsandnature\/the-human-and-environmental-impact-of-bananas\/","2":"phys.org\/news\/2019-09-impact-climate-global-banana-yields.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Benefits of Bananas"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"They contain several essential nutrients and provide benefits for digestion, heart health and weight loss.\nUnripe bananas contain resistant starch, which acts like soluble fiber and escapes digestion.\nBoth pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by slowing the emptying of your stomach (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, bananas also rank low to medium on the glycemic index (GI), which is a measure \u2014 from 0\u2013100 \u2014 of how quickly foods increase blood sugar levels.\nThis means that bananas should not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in healthy individuals.\nHowever, this may not apply to people with type 2 diabetes, who should probably avoid eating a lot of well-ripened bananas \u2014 and monitor their blood sugar carefully if they do.\nResistant starch escapes digestion and ends up in your large intestine, where it becomes food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13).\nNo study has directly tested the effects of bananas on weight loss.\nEating more fiber from vegetables and fruits like bananas has repeatedly been linked to lower body weight and weight loss (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, unripe bananas are packed with resistant starch, so they tend to be very filling and may reduce your appetite (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, bananas contain a decent amount of magnesium, which is also important for heart health (26Trusted Source, 27).\nFruits and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary antioxidants, and bananas are no exception.\nThese antioxidants are linked to many health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease and degenerative illnesses (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nResistant starch is a type of indigestible carb \u2014 found in unripe bananas and other foods \u2014 which functions like soluble fiber in your body.\nOn the other hand, yellow, ripe bananas contain lower amounts of resistant starch and total fiber \u2014 but proportionally higher amounts of soluble fiber.\nSeveral studies reveal that 15\u201330 grams of resistant starch per day may improve insulin sensitivity by 33\u201350% in as few as four weeks (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nUnripe bananas are a great source of resistant starch.\nAs a good dietary source of potassium, bananas may be especially beneficial for maintaining healthy kidneys.\nOne 13-year study in women determined that those who ate bananas 2\u20133 times per week were 33% less likely to develop kidney disease (38Trusted Source).\nOther studies note that those who eat bananas 4\u20136 times a week are almost 50% less likely to develop kidney disease than those who don\u2019t eat this fruit (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nBananas are often referred to as the perfect food for athletes largely due to their mineral content and easily digested carbs.\nEating bananas may help reduce exercise-related muscle cramps and soreness, which affect up to 95% of the general population (40Trusted Source).\nBananas are a popular fruit that happens to provide numerous health benefits.\nBananas do contain carbs that can raise blood sugar, but they also have fiber and beneficial nutrients.\nBananas are nutritious, but also high in sugar and carbs.\nBananas contain many beneficial nutrients, but they are also high in carbs and sugar.\nThis article reviews the health effects of bananas.\nFruit is linked to many health benefits, but it contains sugar, leading many to question its effects on weight loss.","1":"Bananas are a healthy source of fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and various antioxidants and phytonutrients.\nGreen bananas contain up to 80% starch measured in dry weight.\nDuring ripening, the starch is converted into sugars and ends up being less than 1% when the banana is fully ripe (2).\nIn your large intestine, this starch is fermented by bacteria to form butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that appears to have beneficial effects on gut health (4Trusted Source).\nBananas are also a good source of other types of fiber, such as pectin.\nUnripe bananas may contain decent amounts of resistant starch, which functions like fiber, aiding your gut and promoting healthy blood sugar levels.\nBananas contain a number of vitamins and minerals in decent amounts.\nFruits and vegetables contain numerous types of bioactive plant compounds, and bananas are no exception.\nLike other fruits, bananas contain several healthy antioxidants, which are responsible for many of their health benefits.\nBananas are high in potassium, a mineral that promotes heart health and normal blood pressure.\nIn addition, bananas contain antioxidant flavonoids also associated with a significant decrease in heart disease risk (11Trusted Source).\nUnripe, green bananas contain considerable amounts of resistant starch and pectin, which are types of dietary fiber.\nBananas may be beneficial for heart health due to their high levels of potassium and antioxidants.\nIt\u2019s true that bananas are high in starch and sugar.\nBut due to their low GI, moderate consumption of bananas should not raise blood sugar levels nearly as much as other high-carb foods.\nHowever, people with type 2 diabetes should avoid a high intake of well-ripened bananas.\nPotassium, vitamin C, catechin, and resistant starch are among their healthy nutrients.\nBananas may have numerous benefits \u2014 including improved heart and digestive health \u2014 when consumed regularly as a part of a healthy lifestyle.\nHere are 7 benefits of red bananas \u2014 and how they differ\u2026 Bananas contain many beneficial nutrients, but they are also high in carbs and sugar.\nThis article reviews the health effects of bananas.\nBananas do contain carbs that can raise blood sugar, but they also have fiber and beneficial nutrients.\nBananas are nutritious, but also high in sugar and carbs.","2":"Bananas sometimes get a bad rap for having lots of calories and carbs, but they're actually one of the best foods you can choose \u2014 both for health and weight management.\nWe love them paired with a source of lean protein and healthy fat; try five fun recipes that we love: While your average banana contains about 14 grams of naturally occurring sugar, it also provides plenty of other vitamins, minerals, and important nutrients.\nIt's true that eating ANY food in excess of your own personal calorie needs can lead to weight gain, but bananas are an unlikely culprit.\nAt 100 calories and less than half a gram of fat in each one, bananas are a nutritious choice that helps you meet your needs for daily veggies and fruit.\nThat said, it's unlikely that eating a banana peel would hurt you \u2013 but it won't exactly taste very good either."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/11-proven-benefits-of-bananas","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/bananas","2":"www.goodhousekeeping.com\/health\/diet-nutrition\/a47807\/banana-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
