Nutrition, Calories and More","2":"Shrimp Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Shrimp is a small but nutritious type of seafood that is part of the crustaceans group of shellfish.\nOn the positive side, shrimp contains a broad range of essential nutrients, and it also offers some unique benefits.\nIn this article, we analyze the nutrition profile, health benefits, and potential concerns in full.\nPer 100 grams, shrimp provides 540 mg of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of DHA and EPA (1).\nWhile this isn\u2019t quite as high as oily fish, shrimp is still an excellent source of this essential fatty acid.\nShrimp contains a major antioxidant compound called astaxanthin, which we can also find in other crustaceans like lobster, crab, and fish such as salmon (8).\nOn this note, cell culture studies show that astaxanthin taken from shrimp helps to reduce oxidative stress and causes the cell death of cancer cells (9).\nHowever, clinical human intervention studies have demonstrated that astaxanthin has benefits for skin health.\nShrimp is one of these dietary sources of vitamin D, and it provides 152 IU per 100 grams, which is equal to 38% of the RDI (1).\nShrimp also contains several nutrients linked to improved cardiovascular health, such as the previously mentioned omega-3.\nAs shown in the nutrition facts, shrimp offers a wide range of beneficial nutrients for minimal calories (106 kcal per 100 grams).\nAmong the nutrients shrimp offer, they are particularly high in selenium, supplying 57% of the RDI for the mineral.\nAlmost all seafood is an impressive source of nutrients, but mercury contamination is a common concern with seafood.\nUnfortunately, this mercury can concentrate in fish and shellfish, which poses risks to the people who consume them.\nFurthermore, shrimp contain a high ratio of selenium compared to mercury (higher than 1:1).\nShrimp is an excellent source of protein; it contains more than 20 grams of the macronutrient per 100 grams.\nAll values are raw (1, 21, 22); As the table shows, shrimp is one of the best dietary sources of protein.\nThe best way to get iodine is from seafood, and shellfish and seaweed are especially good sources.\nAmongst seafood, shrimp is one of the very best iodine sources, and a 3-oz serving (85 grams) provides around 35 mcg of iodine (26).\nNote: for one of the best dietary sources of iodine, see this guide to abalone.\nShrimp is an excellent source of taurine, which is an amino acid with several potential health-protective properties.\nSeafood is the best dietary source of taurine, and shrimp offers the third highest concentration behind clams and octopus (30).\nShrimp are an excellent source of nutrition, and they offer a significant number of beneficial compounds for very few calories.\nOverall, this small shellfish is a great way to increase our intake of omega-3 and protein.\nConsuming shrimp should also significantly improve the nutrient density of most diets.","1":"Additionally, it is commonly believed that farm-raised shrimp may have some negative health effects compared to wild-caught shrimp.\nAdditionally, the same serving size provides more than 20 different vitamins and minerals, including 50% of your daily needs for selenium, a mineral that may help reduce inflammation and promote heart health (1, 2Trusted Source).\nShrimp is also one of the best food sources of iodine, an important mineral that many people are deficient in.\nShrimp is also a good source of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to astaxanthin antioxidants, which may have a variety of health benefits (1, 6Trusted Source).\nMany people fear foods that are high in cholesterol due to the belief that they increase the cholesterol in your blood, and thus promote heart disease.\nThis is because most of the cholesterol in your blood is produced by your liver, and when you eat foods high in cholesterol, your liver produces less (8Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, shrimp contains several nutrients that may actually boost health, such as omega-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin antioxidants (6Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nBoth of these are important factors in reducing the risk of heart disease (14Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that 356 women who consumed shellfish, including shrimp, on a regular basis had significantly lower triglycerides and blood pressure levels compared to those who did not include shellfish in their diets (15Trusted Source).\nResearch has also shown that people who consume shrimp regularly do not have a higher risk of heart disease compared to those who do not eat it (16Trusted Source).\nAlthough more research is needed to explore shrimp\u2019s role in heart health, it has a variety of beneficial properties that may outweigh its cholesterol content.\nFirst, many studies have found astaxanthin may help strengthen arteries, which may reduce the risk of heart attacks.\nIt may also help increase levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, an important factor in heart health (6Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nDespite these findings, more human research is needed to determine the overall role that the astaxanthin in shrimp may have on overall health.\nFarm-raised seafood from other countries is frequently treated with antibiotics due to its high susceptibility to disease.\nBecause of this, farm-raised shrimp contaminated with antibiotics has the potential to enter the US food supply (25Trusted Source).\nOne study that investigated the antibiotic content of US-purchased seafood found that a sample of farm-raised shrimp contained a detectable amount of sulfadimethoxine, an antibiotic not permitted for use in shrimp in the US (25Trusted Source).\nShellfish, including shrimp, are classified as one of the top eight food allergies in the US, along with fish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, milk and soy (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nOther proteins in shrimp that may trigger an allergic reaction include arginine kinase and hemocyanin (32Trusted Source).\nSymptoms of shrimp allergies vary, and may include tingling in the mouth, digestive issues, nasal congestion or skin reactions after eating it (33Trusted Source).\nIt is high in several vitamins and minerals, and is a rich source of protein.\nEating shrimp may also promote heart and brain health due to its content of omega-3 fatty acids and the antioxidant astaxanthin (6Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nAlthough shrimp is high in cholesterol, it has not been found to have a negative impact on heart health.\nEating shrimp may actually help lower your levels of triglycerides and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nDespite the health benefits of shrimp, there are some concerns about the quality of farm-raised shrimp, such as potential contamination with antibiotics.\nHere are 7 high-cholesterol foods that are very healthy.\nShrimp was once considered bad for heart health and cholesterol numbers.\nBut high LDL cholesterol levels in\u2026 The role of dietary cholesterol in human health has been a controversial topic.","2":"Malia Frey is a weight loss expert, certified health coach, weight management specialist, personal trainer\u200b, and fitness nutrition specialist.\nScientists have dispelled old assumptions about the dangers of cholesterol from food.1\ufeff While cardiologists once advised patients to avoid shrimp (which is naturally high in cholesterol), times have changed.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for 3 oz (84g) of boiled or steamed shrimp.2\ufeff Shrimp is naturally very low in carbohydrates, with under 1 gram per 3 oz serving.\nThe cooking method and preparation, however, will affect nutritional values.\nShrimp contain about 1 gram of fat per 3 oz serving, however, they are almost devoid of the saturated fats associated with heart disease.1\ufeff Most of the fat in shrimp comes from beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and polyunsaturated fats.\nIt is a heart-healthy way to boost your protein intake without taking in extra saturated fats.\nShrimp is a great source of phosphorus and vitamin B12.3\ufeff Shrimp also provides some calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, and choline.\nHere are some of the health benefits you might stand to gain by ordering shrimp more often.\nWhen prepared with minimal processing, shrimp is a whole food and lean source of protein.\nShrimp is a good source of choline, which impacts homocysteine levels, an important marker for heart disease.4\ufeff Although shrimp contains cholesterol, it is nearly devoid of saturated fat.\nNewer research suggests that it's the saturated fat in food, not dietary cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease.1\ufeff Unlike most seafood, shrimp contains almost zero mercury, making it a safer choice for women looking to gain the health benefits of seafood during pregnancy.3 Furthermore, shrimp provides many key nutrients that are beneficial in pregnancy, like iron, B12, calcium, zinc, choline, and protein.56 Enjoy safely prepared shrimp as a nutritious choice while pregnant.\nLuckily, high protein foods, like shrimp, may help.\nStudies show that protein impacts multiple appetite hormone pathways, making it easier to avoid regaining weight that's been lost.7\ufeff Following a meal pattern that's higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates improves satiety and regulates food intake naturally.\nThere is some evidence that choline from foods like shrimp is beneficial for cognitive function.4\ufeff Although the research is limited, choline is being considered in the treatment of dementia and neurological damage for stroke patients.\nIn addition, krill oil has been shown to provide neuroprotective effects due to its astaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids,8\ufeff which are also present in shrimp.\nShrimp offers several nutrients involved in maintaining bone health.\nAlong with providing some calcium, magnesium, and selenium, shrimp is above all, an excellent source of protein.\nLarge prospective studies show significant reductions in bone fractures related to protein intake.9\ufeff Including a lean source of protein, from foods like shrimp, could be especially beneficial for osteoporosis prevention in older adults.\nShellfish allergies are common and typically include a reaction to shrimp, lobster, and crab.\nMost people with shellfish allergies can still eat fish and mollusks (like scallops and mussels).\nManaging a shellfish allergy means learning how to read food labels and avoiding cross-contamination.\nShrimp can be purchased raw or cooked, fresh or frozen, prepared, smoked, pickled, dried, or canned.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that you only buy fresh shrimp when they are frozen, refrigerated, or displayed on a thick bed of ice that is not melting.12\ufeff Look for shrimp that are translucent and shiny with little to no odor.\nThe flesh should become pearly and opaque.13\ufeff Consider adding chilled, cooked shrimp for a boost of protein and flavor in salads.\nBreading shrimp, deep frying it, or cooking it in dishes with creamy sauces will add excess calories and fat, and diminish the benefits you stand to gain from this lean seafood.\nInstead, choose healthier cooking methods to get the most out of your shrimp consumption.\ndoi:10.3390\/nu10060780 Shrimp, steamed or boiled.\nCan you get jumbo benefits from eating shrimp?.\nProtein intake and bone
