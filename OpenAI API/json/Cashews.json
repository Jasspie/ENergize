butter, the cashew is beloved all around the world for its versatility and its rich flavor.\nRich in protein, healthy fats, and antioxidants such as polyphenols, cashews offer a variety of noteworthy health benefits.\nMuch of the fat in cashews comes from stearic acids, which experts believe has a neutral impact on blood cholesterol.\nResearch suggests that people who eat a small serving of cashews every day see a minor reduction in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol.\nIn addition to lowering rates of LDL cholesterol, cashews may help to prevent heart disease due to their high magnesium content.\nProper magnesium intake may reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease, which often occurs when the heart does not receive enough blood.\nThe magnesium in cashews may help to reduce the risk of stroke.\nCashews are a wonderful source of healthy fats, including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated varieties.\nThese nuts are also a modest source of protein.\nOn a long-term basis, cashews can be kept in the fridge or freezer.\nWhile often enjoyed on their own as a snack, cashews can also be incorporated into a variety of meals.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture FoodData Central: \"Cashews, Unsalted.\" World's Healthiest Foods: \"Cashew.\" \u00a9 2005 - 2021 WebMD LLC.","2":"They\u2019ve been linked to benefits like weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and a healthier heart.\nOne ounce (28 grams) of unroasted, unsalted cashews provides you with around (1Trusted Source): Cashews are especially rich in unsaturated fats \u2014 a category of fats linked to a lower risk of premature death and heart disease (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nCashews are low in sugar and rich in fiber, heart-healthy fats, and plant protein.\nNuts and seeds are considered antioxidant powerhouses, and cashews are no exception (11Trusted Source).\nIn turn, this helps reduce inflammation and increases your body\u2019s ability to stay healthy and free from disease (12Trusted Source).\nCashews are a rich source of polyphenols and carotenoids \u2014 two classes of antioxidants also found in other tree nuts (13Trusted Source).\nStudies link antioxidants in nuts like walnuts, pecans, and almonds to lower levels of oxidative cell damage (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nThis may be particularly true of roasted cashews, which appear to have an increased antioxidant activity compared with their raw counterparts (17Trusted Source).\nThat said, the number of cashew-specific studies are limited and more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (17Trusted Source).\nCashews are rich in carotenoids and polyphenols, two categories of antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and offer protection from disease.\nHowever, research is starting to link nut-rich diets to greater weight loss and overall lower body weights than nut-free diets (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, roasting or grinding nuts may increase your body\u2019s ability to fully digest them, thereby increasing the number of calories absorbed (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nAs a result, weight loss benefits may be strongest for whole, raw cashews, although more research is needed to confirm this.\nIn addition to providing fewer calories than expected, nuts are also rich in protein and fiber, which are known to reduce hunger and promote feelings of fullness, both of which can further promote weight loss (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nDiets rich in nuts, including cashews, have been consistently linked to a lower risk of disease, such as stroke and heart disease (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nOne found that people with type 2 diabetes who consumed 10% of their daily calories from cashews had lower LDL (bad) cholesterol to HDL (good) cholesterol ratios than those who ate no cashews at all (28Trusted Source).\nA low LDL to HDL ratio is typically viewed as a marker of good heart health (29Trusted Source).\nTwo other studies link cashew nut consumption to higher HDL cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure, as well as lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nThey conclude that although cashews are just as likely to benefit heart health as other nuts, more research is needed to confirm this.\nNut-rich diets are consistently shown to be beneficial to heart health.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes may benefit from adding cashews to their diet.\nThat\u2019s in part because cashews are a good source of fiber, a nutrient that helps prevent blood sugar spikes and which is believed to offer protection against type 2 diabetes (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHowever, in one study, people with type 2 diabetes who ate 10% of their daily calories from cashews had overall lower insulin levels \u2014 a marker of blood sugar control \u2014 than those who ate no cashews at all (28Trusted Source).\nSubstituting foods higher in net carbs and sugar with cashews is likely to help reduce blood sugar levels (11Trusted Source).\nThat said, more research is needed to examine the effects of cashew-rich diets in people with type 2 diabetes.\nCashews are low in sugar and rich in fiber \u2014 two factors which, when combined, may help reduce blood sugar levels and protect against the development of type 2 diabetes.\nIf your goal is to limit excess salt or added fats, consider choosing dry roasted or raw unsalted cashew varieties whenever possible (36Trusted Source).\nChoose dry roasted or raw unsalted varieties whenever possible.\nSome research suggests that roasted cashews may contain higher levels of health-promoting antioxidants than raw cashews.\nConsider roasting raw cashews yourself at home without extra oils (17Trusted Source).\nSoaking your nuts overnight before adding them to dishes will help reduce their phytate content and improve their digestibility (37Trusted Source).\nFor most benefits, consider purchasing raw, unsalted cashews and soaking them before eating, whenever possible.\nSimilarly to nuts, cashews may promote weight loss, blood sugar control, and heart health.\nJust remember to pick unsalted dry roasted or raw varieties whenever possible.\nThis article explores whether cashews are truly nuts\u2026 You may be at increased risk for a cashew allergy if you're allergic to another tree nut.\nThey have various impressive health benefits and can even help you lose weight."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"planters.com","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-cashews","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/are-cashews-good-for-you"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 100","1":"
