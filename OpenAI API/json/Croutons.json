seasoned, recommended daily values and analysis."},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Croutons are small baked or saut\u00e9ed pieces of bread that add savory taste and crunch to a salad, soup, and other dishes.\nHealth experts advise that at least half the grains you consume should be whole grains to help you get more fiber in your diet.\nWhole grain croutons can be hard to find at your local market, but making them at home can help you meet that fiber recommendation.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 0.5 ounces (about 14g) of plain croutons.1 There are almost 58 calories and 10.4 grams of carbohydrates in a single 0.5-ounce serving of plain croutons.\nIf you make whole wheat croutons at home, you're likely to benefit from about 1.4 grams of fiber in a half-cup serving.2 A 0.5-ounce serving of seasoned croutons provides about 66 calories, 2.6 grams of fat, 9g of carbohydrate, 0.7g of fiber, 0.6 g of added sugar, 189mg of sodium, and 1.53g of protein.3 There is no recorded glycemic index (GI) for croutons.\nBut the glycemic index of white bread is 73\u201377, making it a high glycemic food.\nWhole wheat bread has a slightly lower glycemic index of 72\u201376, and specialty bread baked with whole grains are much lower at around 51\u201355.4 Croutons are likely to have a slightly lower GI because any fat used to saut\u00e9 them can help to slow the food's impact on blood sugar.\nThere is less than a full gram of fat in a serving of croutons, although nutrition facts can vary based on the variety that you choose.\nIf the croutons were made from enriched bread, it is likely that the bread had certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid) and iron added back after processing.\nBut because your crouton serving is likely to be small, you're still not going to consume significant amounts of these nutrients.\nCroutons may be able to provide some limited health benefits, especially if they are made from whole grain bread.\nBut most brands of croutons made from enriched bread are not going to contribute to your health in any substantial way.\nCroutons provide calories (energy) primarily in the form of carbohydrates.\nHealth experts generally advise, however, that we get carbohydrates from nutrient-rich sources like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables because they may also provide vitamins and minerals.5 If you make whole wheat croutons at home, you'll give your body a small boost of fiber.\nCurrent guidelines set forth by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that adults under 50 should consume between 25\u201334 grams of fiber per day depending on age group and sex.5 Fiber can help relieve constipation and improve the regularity of your bowel movements.\nInsoluble fiber (found in whole grains) is sometimes used to treat or prevent constipation and diverticulitis which affects the colon, according to the National Institutes of Health.6 A higher intake of whole grains is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and total cancer.\nIt is also associated with a lower risk for all-cause and disease-specific mortality.7 Even though your whole grain intake from croutons is not likely to be substantial, choosing whole-grain croutons over croutons made from enriched grains on a regular basis may help you take advantage of these health benefits.\nThose who are allergic to wheat should not consume croutons.\nThe law requires that food manufacturers that make products containing allergens such as wheat must include the presence of the allergen, in clear language, on the ingredient label.\nThose with allergies should note that due to COVID-19, the FDA is temporarily allowing food manufacturers to make small ingredient changes to their products without adjusting food labels to help mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nBut these changes do not affect foods containing allergens like wheat.\nFor safety reasons, the FDA states ingredient changes can only be made without adjusting food labels as long as they do not cause adverse health effects in those with food allergies and sensitivities.9\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff There are some people who may want to exercise caution when choosing whether or not to consume croutons.\nThe gluten or sodium in croutons may cause problems for some individuals with certain health conditions.\nIf you have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, you should not consume croutons made from gluten-containing grains.\nWheat allergy is sometimes confused with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\nThere are also brands that sell gluten-free bread, so if you enjoy croutons and follow a gluten-free diet, you can make your own croutons at home.\nCroutons can increase the sodium content of certain foods like soups or salads that are already high in sodium.\nCroutons usually contain added salt.\nIn addition, they may contain seasoning blends or other high-sodium ingredients (such as parmesan cheese).\nCurrent dietary guidelines suggest that adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of salt per day.5 The American Heart Association (AHA) agrees, but suggests that an intake of 1,500 mg per day is more ideal, especially for those with high blood pressure.10 If you are sensitive to salt or if you follow a low-salt diet to manage a condition such as hypertension, look for low-sodium croutons.\nOr you can make your own croutons at home using seasonings that don't contain sodium.\nOften, these are larger croutons, made from fresh bread and seasoned with premium herbs and spices.\nSometimes these croutons look more like a small slice of bread than a cube.\nAccording to the USDA, croutons should generally be consumed within 5\u20136 months after purchase for the best freshness and quality.\nUpdated April 26, 2019.","1":"It also provides around 1.5 grams of dietary fiber, which represents 6 percent of the recommended daily value.\nThe USDA Nutrient Database reveals that croutons have a dietary folate equivalent of 63 micrograms, which makes up approximately 15 percent of the daily recommended intake, which is 400 micrograms.\nThis amount represents 16 percent of the recommended daily value.\nThe amount of sodium present in croutons is 209 milligrams, which is about 9 percent of the daily value.\nIn 30 grams of seasoned croutons, there are 186 calories and 7 grams of fat, which consists of 4.7 grams of unsaturated fat and 2.1 grams of saturated fat.\nAs for vitamins, seasoned croutons provide double the amount of riboflavin, as well as 0.2 milligrams of vitamin E and 3 micrograms of vitamin K.\nBeginning of dialog window.\nEnd of dialog window.","2":"Could Not Retrieve
