Instead, it\u2019s that the number of juvenile lobsters that make it to adulthood has dropped in southern New England and risen sharply in the Gulf of Maine.\nThe arrival of the lobster seems like a boon for Mainers, but the thing that pushed them north hasn\u2019t gone away: warming ocean temperatures.\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, from 1982 to 2006, sea surface temperatures in the coastal Northeast warmed by close to twice the global rate.\nSea surface temperature trends in the Gulf of Maine (top) and the global ocean (bottom).\n\u201cWhere it\u2019s already warm, like Southern New England, a couple of degrees increase may have some really bad effects.\nYou get above that 20oC threshold too often and you start seeing mass die offs,\" said to Rick Wahle, a research professor at University of Maine's Darling Marine Center.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen those, like in Long Island Sound.\u201d The fall of 1999, lobstermen in Long Island Sound saw a huge lobster die-off after a long stretch of anomalous above-average water temperatures.\nAccording to a Connecticut Sea Grant report on the incident, roughly 70% of the lobstermen in Long Island Sound lost 100% of their fishing income that year.\nThe report said the lobster population was \u201cseverely stressed by sustained, hostile environmental conditions, driven by above-average water temperatures.\u201d Scientists also identified a new lobster disease that year: paramoebiasis.\nThe scientists reported that the paramoebae were able to infect the lobsters due to weakened immune systems resulting from the long stretch of above-average temperatures.\nLobsters aren\u2019t the only New England marine species feeling the heat.\nHare was the lead author of a recent Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment, in which NOAA researchers examined 82 species in the Northeast \u2014including lobsters \u2014to evaluate how they will be affected by warming ocean temperatures.\nLobsters, scallops, and clams, which live on the ocean bottom and have limited mobility, are some of the species most vulnerable to climate effects in the region.\nIn July 2015, the ICES Journal of Marine Science dedicated an entire supplement to research on lobsters in a changing climate.\nOne of the papers highlighted the importance of climate-related impacts beyond rising ocean temperatures.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cgain a greater understanding of how hypoxia [low oxygen], ocean acidification, and the shifting ranges of predators and competitors impact the changing geography of lobster distributions,\u201d said the researchers.\nA new study released in September, on which Wahle was a co-author, examined acidification in the context of warming.\nWhile acidification had no real effect on the survival of the larval lobsters, scientists \u201csaw higher mortality rates at the warmer temperatures,\u201d said Wahle.\n\u201cThe economy in Maine and the community is very tied to lobster, so any negative climate change impact could have a big effect,\u201d said Hare.\nFrom 1970 to 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada reported lobster landings rose from roughly 33 million pounds to more than 1.5 billion pounds.\nHare said this trend is likely to continue, but it could be slowed down in coming decades by a natural climate pattern known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO).\nThe AMO is an ocean circulation pattern that brings warmed water from the tropics to higher latitudes.\nSince the mid-90s, the AMO has been in a warm phase, amplifying global warming\u2019s influence on North Atlantic temperatures.\nGlobal Average Temperature compared with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) Index through 2009.\nThe AMO Index is the average sea-surface temperature over the North Atlantic Ocean.\nSo it\u2019s [the Northwest Atlantic\u2019s] been warming really fast,\u201d said Hare, who added that scientists aren\u2019t sure if that rate will keep up when the AMO goes colder.\nOn the 100- year scale it\u2019s pretty straight-forward, greenhouse gas emissions cause warmer temperatures both in the air and in the ocean.\nThe story originally stated that sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine were warming 99% faster than the rest of the planet.\nConfronting Climate Change in the U.S. Northeast: Science, Impacts, and Solutions.\nSynthesis Report of the

shrimp, crab, and crayfish, lobster is a crustacean, a type of shellfish characterized by its segmented body protected by a shell (1Trusted Source).\nThis article explains all you need to know about the nutrition of lobster, including whether the cholesterol it contains should be a reason for concern.\nHowever, cholesterol content is independent of fat content, and a serving of lobster provides 70% of the DV for cholesterol (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA are two types of omega-3 fatty acids that may protect heart health by lowering blood cholesterol levels.\nAlthough lobster provides more protein per serving than the other crustaceans, they are all protein-rich foods.\nLastly, while they are all rich in EPA and DHA, shrimp, crayfish, and crab provide lower amounts than lobster.\nLobster is a lean protein food with high amounts of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nAdditionally, research suggests that high protein foods may aid or promote weight loss by boosting your metabolism and increasing feelings of fullness (11Trusted Source).\nStudies suggest that people who consume diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids have a lower risk of stroke, depression, dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, research suggests that low vitamin B12 levels are associated with dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease (17Trusted Source).\nHowever, some studies suggest that taking vitamin B12 supplements seems to reduce the risk of dementia by 20% and improve brain function in older adults (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nTo help prevent this condition, public health initiatives recommend regularly eating fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nStudies have repeatedly shown that long-chain omega-3s, such as EPA and DHA, have protective effects against heart disease.\nFish and seafood species that provide high amounts of both \u2014 such as lobster \u2014 seem to be the most protective (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA may reduce the risk of heart disease in several ways.\nOne 2008 study found that intakes of 566 mg per day of EPA and DHA may reduce heart disease risk by 37% (24Trusted Source).\nIn a 2010 study, participants took up to 234 mg of EPA and DHA per day, and the researchers reported that for participants who took the highest amounts, the risk of heart disease decreased by 49% and the risk of heart attack-related deaths decreased by 62% (25Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that diets rich in EPA, DHA, and selenium may have a protective effect against several types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, gastric, liver, and ovarian cancers (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nTest tube and animal studies have found that the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of omega-3s have reduced tumor growth and spread and led to cancer cell death (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nStudies have shown that selenium may promote tumor death and help prevent cancer from spreading (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nAdding lobster to your diet may have some additional health benefits, thanks to the selenium it contains.\nLobster\u2019s high selenium content may be beneficial for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nScientists need to do more research to investigate the health benefits of lobster in humans.\nNutrients in lobster may offer beneficial effects for heart and mental health and weight loss.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition While lobster has a relatively high amount of cholesterol, this may not be a health concern.\nSome research suggests that cholesterol from food sources is not associated with heart disease risk (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nHowever, some of these studies have been lower quality, and scientists need to do more high quality studies to investigate this topic further (38Trusted Source).\nOlder studies explain that this is because your body can regulate its cholesterol production based on how much cholesterol you eat (39Trusted Source).\nThus, it maintains the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio and avoids increasing the risk of heart disease (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nResearch has found that about one-quarter of the population is more sensitive to higher cholesterol intakes (37Trusted Source).\nLobster contains a high amount of cholesterol, but this is not a health concern for most people.\nStudies have found that cholesterol from food sources does not appear to increase the risk of heart disease.\nLobster is a highly perishable food that requires proper handling to avoid microbial contamination.\nSome of the most common disease-causing bacteria linked to improperly handled crustaceans \u2014 and raw seafood in general \u2014 are Vibrio species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella species, and Shigella species (1Trusted Source).\nCrustaceans are some of the most common allergens that may cause severe food reactions, and lobsters are among the most allergenic (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source).\nAs a result of water pollution, lobsters and other shellfish may become contaminated with heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic (1Trusted Source).\nTo keep your lobster on the healthier side, be mindful of preparation and cooking methods that significantly increase calorie and fat content.\nLobster is a type of crustacean rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\nAdding it to your diet may be beneficial for weight loss and mental health and may help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.","1":"It provides a nutritional breakdown of lobster and an in-depth look at its possible health benefits, as well as ways to incorporate more lobster into your diet, and any potential health risks of consuming lobster.\nLobster is a rich source of copper and selenium and also contains zinc, phosphorus, vitamin B12, magnesium, vitamin E, and a small amount of omega-3 fatty acids.\nHowever, recent studies have suggested that not all cholesterol content in foods is harmful to the body and that saturated fat intake is more directly related to an increase in harmful cholesterol levels.\nPolyunsaturated fats can help reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of stroke and heart disease.\nWhile its overall fat content is high, lobster is not a significant source of saturated fat.\nMany studies have suggested that consuming more fish and shellfish decreases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease while promoting healthy cholesterol levels.\nFish and shellfish, such as lobster, are especially important for providing omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in very few foods.\nAlthough the fatty acid content in lobster is not the highest among fish and shellfish, it is still a considerable source of these important nutrients.\nA meta-analysisTrusted Source has shown that those with thyroid disease who are selenium-deficient experience noted benefits when increasing their selenium intake, including improved general wellbeing, enhanced mood, and improved thyroid function.\nMaking sure that a child consumes enough selenium can help reduce the risk of ADHD.\nLobster has one of the highest copper contents of any food.\nWhile lobster may seem like an expensive, decadent treat, eating live-cooked lobsters is not the only way to include this lean, delicious seafood in your diet.\nLobster can contain a moderate level of mercury and should be consumed six times or less per month.\nTo minimize the risk of food-borne illness, buy properly refrigerated, fresh lobster at 40\u00ba Fahrenheit (F) or below.\nIt is important to note that the total diet or overall eating pattern is the most important factor for disease prevention and healthy function.\nIt is better to eat a diet with variety than to concentrate on individual foods as the gateway to good health.","2":"However, lobster is also very nutritious, and it provides a wide range of beneficial nutrients.\nThis article provides an in-depth guide to the nutritional values and potential benefits of lobster.\nLobster is a good source of B vitamins, and it also offers a broad range of minerals.\nBased on the nutritional composition of lobster, it offers several potential health benefits.\nPer 100 calories, lobster contains 21.5 grams of protein.\nA typical medium-sized lobster offers approximately 56 grams of protein (1).\nOn the positive side, lobster provides 81 mg of choline per 100 grams, which is equivalent to 15% of the daily value (1, 2).\nLobster contains substantial amounts of copper and selenium; per 100 grams, it provides more than 100% of the daily value for both minerals (1, 2).\nSimilar to other crustacean species of shellfish such as shrimp and crab, lobster shells have a red hue.\nRecent systematic reviews of published studies have found that: Chemical analysis of lobster found that it provides between 54 mcg and 295 mcg astaxanthin per gram.\nWhile lobster doesn\u2019t provide as much omega-3 as oily fish varieties, it does offer a source of these essential fats.\nAs shown in the nutritional values, lobster supplies 0.25 grams of omega-3 per 100-gram serving.\nThis amount is equivalent to 0.75 grams of omega-3 per medium lobster (1).\nShellfish are one of the most common allergens in the human diet, and this is especially true for crustacean species such as crab, lobster, and shrimp (15, 16).\nAccording to this research, here were the mean amounts of mercury contamination in the following lobster species (20): While this level of mercury contamination is not as high as shark (0.979 PPM) or swordfish (0.995 PPM), it is higher than smaller fish like sardines (0.013 PPM) and anchovies (0.016 PPM).\nLobsters contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol; a 3.5 oz (100-gram) serving of cooked lobster provides 145 mg (1).\nLobster has a lot to offer nutritionally: it\u2019s an excellent source of protein, omega-3, B vitamins, and important minerals like copper and selenium.\nThis popular shellfish is also relatively low in mercury and may provide additional benefits from its choline and astaxanthin content."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/lobster-nutrition","1":"www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/303332","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/lobster-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
