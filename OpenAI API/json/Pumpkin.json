used at Halloween and then thrown away - creating 18,000 tonnes of food waste.\nIt\u2019s a similar story in the United States, where most of the 900,000 tonnes of pumpkin produced annually will be trashed, rather than used as food or composted.\nThat feeds into the 1.3 billion tonnes of global food waste created each year.\nTo limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and as close as possible to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, it is essential that businesses, policy-makers, and civil society advance comprehensive near- and long-term climate actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nThe World Economic Forum's Climate Initiative supports the scaling and acceleration of global climate action through public and private-sector collaboration.\nThis includes the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a global network of business leaders from various industries developing cost-effective solutions to transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.\nCEOs use their position and influence with policy-makers and corporate partners to accelerate the transition and realize the economic benefits of delivering a safer climate.","1":"It would like you to know that the pumpkins you carve this month\u2014and inevitably throw into the garbage on November 1\u2014are adding more than 254 million tons of municipal waste to landfills.\nAt those landfills, they are further happy to inform us, the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins that we all throw out will decompose and turn into methane.\nIn commemoration of National Energy Action Month, they want to let you know that they're working on the problem.\nDon't be alarmed: \"The Energy Department's Bioenergy Technologies Office is working together with industry to develop and test integrated biorefineries\u2014facilities capable of efficiently converting plant and waste material into affordable biofuels, biopower and other products.\nBy \"harnessing the potential of bioenergy\" we, the United States of America, will be able to generate our own supply of clean energy,\" thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur only concern is that according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions are not agriculture (and certainly not pumpkins)\u2014which only in total contributes a paltry 9 percent of the problem\u2014but industry, electricity, and transportation.\nAnd is it possible that the Energy Department's seasonal update could possibly\u2014and we raise this question with all due respect\u2014be detracting from the real problem?\nStill, the Department of Energy is proud of its program to harness bioenergy.\nThey say that one biorefinery in McCarran, Nevada, will actually use municipal solid waste \"as a feedstock and use gasification and Fischer-Tr\u00f6psch conversion technology to produce 'drop-in' biofuel for the military.\" Another project will use different types of waste\u2014like fats, oils, and greases\u2014as a feedstock that will be hydro-treated and upgraded.\nThe government is hopeful that they will soon be able to turn the blight caused by these pumpkins into something usable: \"It might not be long until the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins we produce annually are nearly as important to our energy security as they are to Halloween!\"  The comedian and star of the new movie \u2018Bad Trip\u2019 spoke to VICE about coping with COVID and pranking.","2":"It\u2019s pumpkin time in the States as Halloween approaches.\nBut the good news is that a EWG report doesn\u2019t rate them as a particularly dirty fruit.\nFertilizers are used to promote pumpkin growth but also give out large quantities of nitrous oxide.\nThe lowest figure was from a large specialized pumpkin farm that used potassium-based fertilizers.\nSecond best, a small organic farm and next imported pumpkins from Argentina.\nAnd so many of those Halloween pumpkins end up in the trash and then in landfill.\nMethane is a significant greenhouse gas with 25 times the strength of carbon dioxide.\nUsing organic gardening methods is the best way to grow produce for a healthy, low carbon pumpkin.\nI want to know how much carbon is in a pumpkin i grow using only organically certified fertilizers and worm liquid, none of them go to waste, ones that do not go to market get fed to the worms.\nHi Kathy, as you are growing your pumpkin organically, it is likely that your pumpkin has a carbon footprint of around 140g CO2E per kilo of pumpkin."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2019\/10\/halloween-pumpkins-food-waste-energy\/","1":"www.vice.com\/en\/article\/ypxn8j\/the-government-says-our-halloween-pumpkins-are-destroying-the-environment","2":"www.greeneatz.com\/1\/post\/2012\/10\/how-green-is-my-pumpkin.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

loss.\nAntioxidants protect the body from free radicals \u2014 atoms that cause tiny injuries to cells.\nBeta-carotene also triggers the body to release natural killer cells that attack and destroy tumors.\nWhile beta-carotene guards cells from free-radicals, the body is changing it into vitamin A.\nThe body then uses vitamin A to make a protein needed for the eyes to work properly.\nBoth beta-carotene and vitamin A are best obtained from foods like pumpkin, not pills.\nIt offers a long list of nutrients that protect and support the heart, such as vitamins A, B1, B6, and C, copper, fiber, folate, and manganese.\nIn addition, the fiber in pumpkin makes you feel full promoting weight loss.\nAlthough pumpkin is typically safe to eat and offers impressive health benefits, it\u2019s often combined with high-sugar and fat ingredients.\nPumpkin seed shells are safe to eat and an excellent source of fiber.\nHere are some healthy, tasty ways to work pumpkin into your diet: Cleveland

vegetable.\nInterestingly, the variety of pumpkin that\u2019s most typically canned looks more similar to a butternut squash than a jack-o\u2019-lantern.\nIt is nutrient-dense, meaning it has lots of vitamins and minerals and relatively few calories.\nIt\u2019s also exceptionally high in beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant.\nBeta-carotene is a type of carotenoid that turns into vitamin A in the body.\nPumpkins are loaded with a variety of nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nMost of a pumpkin\u2019s health benefits come from its micronutrient content and the fact that it\u2019s a fiber-filled, low-carb fruit.\nWhile there aren\u2019t many studies on pumpkin specifically, it is high in several nutrients that have established health benefits.\nPumpkin gives you a hefty dose of beta-carotene, which is partially converted into vitamin A.\nOther micronutrients in pumpkin also help promote immunity, including vitamins C and E, iron and folate (6Trusted Source).\nSecond, the combination of other vitamins and minerals in pumpkin may protect against age-related macular degeneration.\nOne study found that people with age-related macular degeneration could slow its progression by taking a supplement containing zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and copper (7Trusted Source).\nThese include beta-carotene and vitamins C and E.\nEating foods with beta-carotene can also help improve the appearance and texture of skin.\nEating fruits and vegetables is generally heart-healthy.\nWhat\u2019s more, pumpkin has specific nutrients that are good
