The authors, at Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Italy and at the University of Manchester, UK, report: \u201cThis study, based in Italy, focuses on environmental impacts of deferred catering with the aim of evaluating different options for food preparation and distribution, to help identify environmentally sustainable solutions.\nTwo main types of deferred system (cook-warm and cook-chill) and cooking technologies (pasta cookers and range tops) used in the catering sector are evaluated.\nThe results suggest that cooking in pasta cookers saves up to 60% of energy and 38% of water compared to range tops and therefore reduces by 34-66% the impacts associated with pasta preparation.","2":"The replacement of the ordinary home gas-fired hobs with a more eco-sustainable pasta cooker reduced the damage to \u201cclimate change,\u201d and \u201cresource depletion\".\nAlthough a more sustainable field phase is still to be identified, the environmental impact of dry pasta might be henceforward relieved by replacing the current domestic appliances with novel energy-saving pasta cookers."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.researchgate.net\/publication\/331933680_Environmental_Sustainability_of_Pasta_Production_Chains_An_Integrated_Approach_for_Comparing_Local_and_Global_Chains","1":"www.improbable.com\/2015\/07\/30\/evaluation-of-environmental-impacts-the-case-of-pasta\/","2":"www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/B9780128213636000059"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 0","1":" 70","2":" 100"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"What Are the Health Benefits of Pasta?
