impacts of bell pepper production in greenhouse structure with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method.\nThe normalization results showed that the marine water eco-toxicity, fresh water eco-toxicity and abiotic resources depletion had the highest values among all impact categories, respectively.\nFinally, It is concluded that natural gas is one of the main energy consuming inputs and emission sources
