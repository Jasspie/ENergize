crops, Washington and Michigan growers are concerned about the impact to cherry yields due to our changing climate.\nMichigan farmers experienced a late frost that soured the 2015 cherry season by about a third.\nGary Bardenhagen farms tart cherries in Leelanau County, Michigan, and feels that the likelihood of crop damage from a frost event is increasing.\n\u201cI believe climate change is having an impact on our weather,\u201d he said.\nThe early starts to spring however, do not preclude a late frost event, which can cause damage to the crop.\u201d Although Washington cherry crops overall had a great year, the record extreme heat reduced yields.\nKevin Achelpohl, owner of K&C Farms in Mattawa, Washington, said, \u201cIn June, we had 100-degree plus weather.\nYou have to be finished and quit picking when it\u2019s too warm because the fruit gets too warm, gets soft, and separates from the stems.\u201d \u201cAn average year?\nMonday, June 8 was 105 degrees F, 24 degrees higher than normal (usually 81-82 degrees F for that time period).\u201d \u201cYou sit on those tractors that produce 20 degrees of heat.\nTim Smith, Washington State University Extension tree fruit specialist emeritus, explained: \u201cThe fact is that the weather is so unpredictable and we keep setting records of all sorts.\nWhat I think we are experiencing is screwed-up weather because of climate change.\u201d Nikki Rothwell, Coordinator at the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Research Center has begun to see a shift in farmers\u2019 thinking in her region.\nAgricultural Extension Agencies across the U.S. are beginning to host climate change conferences geared toward adaptation.\nThe Montana Farm Bureau joined with other agricultural organizations, sharing their perspectives on climate change.\nTalk with one of our nation\u2019s 3.2 million farmers and learn about the\u00a0impact our changing climate is having on their crops.\nBoth love cherries and volunteer with Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby.\nCitizens' Climate Education (CCE) is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization.\nCitizens' Climate Lobby (CCL) is a 501(c)4 organization.\nDonations to Citizens' Climate Lobby are not tax-deductible.","1":"Michael Yaziji, Professor of Strategy and Organisation at IMD, suggests that to solve the current environmental issues we need to turn negative outputs into positive inputs.\nThe notion of sustainability-as-less: fewer people, fewer resources, less production, less consumption and less pollution is actually not enough.\nWe absolutely need to do all of these things if we are going to give our children anything like the planet that we inherited, but it needs to be complemented by another approach that leverages the growth imperative that got us in this mess in the first place.\nGiven this, environmental damage can be limited by reducing population, getting poorer and improving technology.\nTherefore firms are not likely to do enough in terms of reduction to turn things around.\nThis would look like cement that has a negative CO2 footprint; or waste product pollution being turned into housing materials.\nThis could also play out in the form of an industrial system that has no waste, or even better, that takes wastes or pollutions from outside the system and converts them into products and services as well as environmental benefits.\nCradle to Cradle, a popular book by William McDonough & Michael Braungart, provides a cherry tree as a beautiful model for us to replicate.\nA cherry tree in full bloom is stunning in its abundant beauty of hundreds of thousands of blossoms.\nTomorrow\u2019s sustainability is called industrial ecology and holds out the promise for a rich, prosperous, and flourishing society that has no waste.\nWe have very few examples of completely sustainable industrial ecologies, but in my strategy work with companies I see more and more companies stumbling into it as they look for new businesses and new business models.\nFor example, the number of firms that are looking into waste-streams as critical inputs is stunning; I\u2019d predict that the waste industry will look nothing like it does today.\nOne smart firm I work with takes waste from municipalities (and gets paid for it), using some of it as in input for construction materials (which they get paid for), and sells the rest to incinerators for fuel (netting yet a third revenue stream).\nThe imperatives that drive firms\u2019 decisions are profit based, but as their standard raw resource inputs become more expensive and less available as there are growing waste streams from other industries, and as regulations are increasingly stringent around raw resource usage and pollution, the opportunities multiply.\nFirms need to be creative, explore profitable business models with waste streams as inputs, leading to overall positive (not just less negative) environmental impacts.\nThey need to think about getting into these new business models and market spaces more and more, rather than focusing on just the old school notion of less and less.\nWe need to limit or reverse population growth as much as possible, but recognize that it isn\u2019t likely to be enough.\nThis is the thinking behind so many companies\u2019 sustainability reports that brag about a 10% reduction of this input resource or a 15% reduction of that pollutant.","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"citizensclimatelobby.org\/climate-change-and-cherries-its-the-pits\/","1":"www.iedp.com\/articles\/the-wasteful-cherry-tree\/","2":"www.researchgate.net\/publication\/266226841_Influence_of_environmental_factors_and_orchard_management_on_yield_and_quality_of_sweet_cherry"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

and More - Dr. Axe"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"The high concentration of plant compounds in cherries may be responsible for this fruit\u2019s many health benefits.\nIn fact, one review found that eating cherries effectively reduced inflammation in 11 out of 16 studies and markers of oxidative stress in 8 out of 10 studies (6Trusted Source).\nCherries are especially high in polyphenols, a large group of plant chemicals that help fight cellular damage, reduce inflammation, and promote overall health (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in cherries may help relieve exercise-induced muscle pain, damage, and inflammation (6Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\nTart cherries and their juice seem to be more effective than sweet varieties, though both may aid athletes.\nTart cherry juice and concentrate have been found to accelerate muscle recovery, decrease exercise-induced muscle pain, and prevent strength loss in elite athletes, such as cyclists and marathon runners (6Trusted Source).\nA study in 27 endurance runners demonstrated that those who consumed 480 mg of powdered tart cherries daily for 10 days before a half-marathon averaged 13% faster race times and experienced less muscle soreness than a placebo group (10Trusted Source).\nA study in 20 active women noted that those who drank 2 ounces (60 ml) of tart cherry juice twice daily for 8 days recovered quicker and had less muscle damage and soreness after completing repeated sprint exercises, compared to the placebo group (11Trusted Source).\nMany studies show that diets rich in fruits are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease (12Trusted Source).\nCherries are particularly beneficial in this regard, as they\u2019re rich in nutrients and compounds that are known to promote heart health, including potassium and polyphenol antioxidants.\nWhat\u2019s more, cherries are rich in powerful polyphenol antioxidants, including anthocyanins, flavonols, and catechins, which may help keep your heart healthy by protecting against cellular damage and reducing inflammation (15Trusted Source).\nIn fact, a study in 84,158 people found that higher intakes of polyphenols \u2014 especially anthocyanins, flavonols, and catechins \u2014 were associated with a significantly decreased risk of heart disease over 5 years (16Trusted Source).\nDue to their potent anti-inflammatory effects, cherries may reduce symptoms of arthritis and gout, a type of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid that can lead to extreme swelling, inflammation, and pain in your joints.\nMany studies show that cherries help inhibit oxidative stress and decrease inflammation by suppressing inflammatory proteins, which can help reduce symptoms related to arthritis.\nA study in 10 women found that eating 2 servings (10 ounces or 280 grams) of sweet cherries after an overnight fast lowered levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and significantly reduced uric acid levels 5 hours after consumption (17Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, cherries contain melatonin, a substance that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle (19Trusted Source).\nA study in 20 people showed that those who drank tart cherry juice concentrate for 7 days experienced significant increases in melatonin levels, sleep duration, and sleep quality, compared to a placebo (19Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, a 2-week study in older adults with insomnia found that drinking 1 cup (240 ml) of tart cherry juice before bed increased sleep time by 84 minutes (20Trusted Source).\nNot only do they contain an array of powerful plant compounds that can help reduce inflammation, but eating them may improve sleep, boost heart health, and speed recovery after exercise.\nLearn where these theories came from and if there\u2019s any science to back\u2026 Black cherry juice for gout may be an effective way to help lower uric acid, which causes the symptoms of gout.\nCherry juice is a delicious drink that provides solid health benefits.","1":"Cherries are not only one of the healthiest fruits, they also rank as one of the most health protective foods overall.\nBut here are seven more reasons why this stone fruit is a nutritional all-star, and easy ways to eat more cherries year-round.\nThe anti-inflammatory effect of cherries helps keep your body healthy; but what's more, cherries rank lower than many fruits on the glycemic index.\nTart cherries in particular are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a hormone that helps control your sleep-wake cycles.\nOne study in men and women with insomnia found that compared to a placebo, eight ounces of tart cherry juice in the morning and again one to two hours before bed increased sleep time by an hour and 24 minutes.\nRegularly incorporating cherries or 100% cherry juice into your meal or snack routine may help lessen your joint pain.\nIn one study, gout patients who consumed cherries for just two days (both the fresh fruit, as well as cherry extract and juice) showed a 35% lower risk of gout attacks compared to those who did not eat cherries.\nResearch has shown that drinking tart cherry juice can help lower total cholesterol, including the \u201cbad\u201d type, known as LDL.\nLook for frozen cherries, freeze-dried powders, 100% tart cherry juice, and preservative-free dried cherries.\nAdd tart cherry juice to sparkling water.","2":"The\u00a0nutrients and bioactive components in cherries support their preventive health benefits.\nA 2018 review of the health benefits of cherries published in the journal Nutrients summarized the results of 29 published human studies that examined the positive effects of cherry consumption.\nResearchers found that eating cherries and products made with cherries decreased oxidative stress, inflammation, exercise-induced muscle soreness and loss of strength, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, arthritis symptoms, and loss of sleep.\n(1) The benefits of cherries come from their\u00a0high levels of antioxidants that fight free radical damage and protect our cells.\nRecent research also indicates that cherries help remove excess body fat and increase\u00a0melatonin.\nNext time you roam the aisles of the grocery store, pick up some fresh, frozen or dried cherries and reap their many health benefits.\nNot only are cherries low in calories, but research suggests that they help reduce the concentration of fats in your blood too.\nIn a 2009 study published in the Journal of Medical Food, rats that received whole tart cherry powder for 90 days, mixed into a high-fat diet, didn\u2019t gain as much weight or build up as much body fat as rats that didn\u2019t receive cherries.\nTart cherry intake was associated with reduced concentration of fats in the blood, percentage fat mass and abdominal fat weight.\nBy consuming tart cherry juice or a cherry supplement, you reduce inflammation and lipids in the blood, which lead to heart conditions and weight gain.\nThe antioxidants found in cherries are known to improve cardiovascular health.\nResearch done at the University of Michigan\u00a0suggests that tart cherries provide cardiovascular benefits and\u00a0can reduce the risk of stroke.\nThe study showed that\u00a0tart cherries activate peroxisome proliferator activating receptors (PPARs)\u00a0isoforms in many of the body\u2019s tissues.\n(3) Research also suggests that the anthocyanins and fiber in cherries contribute to heart health by reducing metabolic risk factors, improving LDL cholesterol levels and benefiting glucose metabolism.\nTheir presence help make cherries a high-antioxidant food.\nIn fact, a study published in the Journal of Natural Products found that the anthocyanins and cyanidin isolated from tart cherries exhibited\u00a0better anti-inflammatory activity than aspirin.\n(5) Anthocyanins from sour cherries have been shown to not only possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, but\u00a0to inhibit tumor development in mice and the growth of human colon cancer cell lines.\nThe body uses antioxidants to prevent itself from the damage caused by oxygen, which\u00a0plays a major role in diseases today and has been linked to health conditions like cancer, heart disease and dementia.\n(6) Another one of the benefits of cherries is they\u00a0fight free radicals that damage the eyes.\nCherries serve as a natural treatment for macular degeneration and\u00a0natural treatment for glaucoma because of their powerful antioxidants that help prevent eye damage.\nBenefits of cherries for skin include their ability to reduce inflammatory conditions that affect your skin, improve elasticity and reduce signs of aging.\nA study published in\u00a0Arthritis & Rheumatism\u00a0evaluated 633 individuals\u00a0with gout who were treated with cherry extract\u00a0over a two-day period.\nThis cherry treatment\u00a0was associated with a 35 percent lower risk of gout attacks.\nWhen cherry intake was combined with allopurinol use, a prescribed medication for gout and kidney stones, the risk of gout attacks was 75 percent lower.\n(8) Cherries are one of the top anti-inflammatory foods.\nThis is thought to be because of the anti-inflammatory properties of tart cherries.\n(11) Plus, cherries are beneficial during pregnancy because they provide potassium, which is needed to help keep your fluid and chemical balance as your blood volume expands.\nA study done at the\u00a0Osteoarthritis Research Center evaluated 58\u00a0non-diabetic patients with osteoarthritis who drank two eight-ounce bottles of tart cherry juice daily for six weeks.\nAs a result of the study,\u00a0Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (known as WOMAC) scores decreased significantly after the tart cherry juice treatment.\nThis suggests that the tart cherry juice provided symptom relief for patients with\u00a0osteoarthritis.\n(12) A 2015 study published in the journal Cell Stress & Chaperones found that when 20 osteoarthritis patients received sour topical cherry seed extract, which is a major protectant against oxidative stress, they experienced significantly less joint pain.\n(13) Tart cherry juice contains high levels of phytochemicals, including melatonin, a molecule critical in regulating\u00a0the sleep-wake cycle.\nIn a study published in the European Journal of Nutrition,\u00a020 volunteers consumed either a placebo or tart cherry juice concentrate for seven days.\nAs a result of this treatment, total melatonin content was significantly elevated in the cherry juice group.\nThis data suggests that tart cherry juice or supplements can benefit sleeping patterns and help people with disrupted sleep or those who can\u2019t sleep.\nOne of the benefits of cherries is that they\u2019re a nutrient-dense food that\u2019s rich in anthocyanins, quercetin, hydroxycinnamates, potassium, carotenoids and melatonin.\nOne of the most powerful benefits of cherries is its high antioxidant content.\nCherries are widely available in grocery stores, especially when they are in season during the summer months.\nThey are known to be the most delicious type of cherry because of their natural sweetness.\nThere are a ton of fun and healthy ways to use cherries.\nJust use a knife, and cut the cherry in half\u00a0\u2014 the pit will come right out.\nThe healthiest way to preserve cherries is in plain water.\nThis Very Cherry Snack Bar is a great way to get kids the antioxidants that they need.\nThe sweet cherry has been consumed since prehistoric times.\nConsuming sweet and tart cherries is completely safe for adults and children.\nThere are no known cherry interactions at this time."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/cherries-benefits","1":"www.health.com\/nutrition\/health-benefits-cherries","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-cherries\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
