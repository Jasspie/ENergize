It's a hypoxic, oxygen-deprived area where, essentially, there's no room for aquatic life, and we know from our study that corn production contributes to 40 percent of that nitrogen pollution.\" \"The reality is that, in some of these regions, groundwater is going to continue to be a source of irrigation, but there are many upgrades in irrigation technologies that can be employed.\nThe fact is that 20 percent of farmers are still using old-fashioned flood mechanisms to irrigate their corn rather than using drip irrigation or center-pivots, which are much more parsimonious in how water is being allocated.\nThere's a lot they can also do to protect soil and the moisture in their soil by not plowing their soil as vigorously as they might otherwise, by doing things like planting cover crops.\" \"Fertilizer application is something that has been studied for many, many years, and there are many great practices that have been identified by scientists and agricultural experts.\nSo there's a risk for them, but we now have technologies, soil testing approaches, and even remote sensing that allows farmers to be much more precise about where, when and how much they apply fertilizer.\" This segment aired on June 11, 2014.","1":"\u201cThe deaths caused per bushel in western corn belt states such as Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska tend to be lower than in eastern corn belt states such as Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio,\u201d commented lead researcher Jason Hill (UMN).\n\u201cFarmers can greatly improve the environmental profile of their corn by using precision agriculture tools and switching to fertilizers that have lower ammonia emissions.\u201d Nitrogen fertilizer use has led to increased concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere, a side effect of the PM2.5 precursor ammonia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for farmers to have this information so that they can implement practices that reduce the environmental impact of the crops they grow,\u201d explained Hill; \u201cFarmers can greatly improve the environmental profile of their corn by using precision agriculture tools and switching to fertilizers that have lower ammonia emissions.\u201d In their paper, recently published in Nature Sustainability, the researchers propose further beneficial strategic interventions for improving future corn production; reduced fertilizer use, improved nitrogen use efficiency and changing the areas where the corn is grown may all contribute to improving the cost to benefit ratio.","2":"New research led by the Institute on the Environment\u2019s NorthStar Initiative for Sustainable Enterprise drills down to the county-level impact of corn production, connecting it for the first time to where corn likely winds up \u2013\u00a0based on the facility-specific demand of large-scale U.S. corn consumers, which include meat and ethanol producers.\nPublished in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the innovative research reveals that the environmental impact of corn varies significantly across geographic consumption locations of sectors and individual producers.\n\u201cOur approach significantly improves supply-chain transparency \u2013 and provides a starting place for companies that are interested in better managing their upstream environmental impacts.\u201d The researchers, led by Timothy Smith, a professor in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering and an IonE Fellow, used publicly available data from 2007 and 2012 to paint a granular picture of corn\u2019s impact across the United States, revealing which counties use the most irrigation water and produce the most greenhouse gas emissions per bushel.\nConnecting this data to corn consumers through a newly developed NiSE tool (foods3.org), revealed insights into the impacts of corn consumption across counties, states, industry sectors, and meat and ethanol companies, as well as individual facilities."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.wbur.org\/hereandnow\/2014\/06\/11\/corn-environmental-risks","1":"www.biotechniques.com\/general-interest\/the-not-so-a-maize-ing-effects-of-corn\/","2":"environment.umn.edu\/news\/new-study-corns-environmental-impact-varies-greatly-across-u-s-opening-door-supply-chain-transparency\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 100","1":" 10","2":" 0"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"Corn 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits","1":"Cash in on the health benefits of corn - Mayo Clinic Health System","2":"Is Corn Good for You? Nutrition Facts and More"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Popcorn and sweet corn are popular varieties, but refined corn products are also widely consumed, frequently as ingredients in processed food.\nWhole-grain corn is as healthy as any cereal grain, as it\u2019s rich in fiber and many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nHere are the nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of boiled yellow corn (1Trusted Source): Like all cereal grains, corn is primarily composed of carbs.\nDespite the sugar in sweet corn, it is not a high-glycemic food, ranking low or medium on the glycemic index (GI) (3).\nWhile the fiber content of different types of corn varies, it\u2019s generally around 9\u201315% of the dry weight (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThe fat content of corn ranges from 5\u20136%, making it a low-fat food (1Trusted Source, 5).\nRefined corn oil is mainly composed of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, while monounsaturated and saturated fats make up the rest (9Trusted Source).\nIt also contains significant amounts of vitamin E, ubiquinone (Q10), and phytosterols, increasing its shelf life and making it potentially effective at lowering cholesterol levels (10, 11Trusted Source).\nIn general, popcorn is rich in minerals, whereas sweet corn is higher in many vitamins.\nA highly popular snack, popcorn is one of the most common whole-grain foods in the United States.\nMore frequently, whole grains are consumed as food ingredients, such as in breads and tortillas (27Trusted Source).\nWhole-grain foods may have several health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nHowever, regular popcorn consumption has not been linked to improved heart health (27Trusted Source).\nEven though popcorn is healthy on its own, it\u2019s often eaten with sugary soft drinks and frequently loaded with added salt and high-calorie cooking oils, all of which may harm your health over time (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s a popular snack food that\u2019s categorized as a whole-grain cereal.\nDietary intake of antioxidants, most notably carotenoids like zeaxanthin and lutein, may boost eye health (25Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHigh levels of these carotenoids in your blood are strongly linked to a reduced risk of both macular degeneration and cataracts (41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\nObservational studies likewise suggest that high dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin may be protective, but not all studies support this (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source).\nOne study in 356 middle-aged and older adults found a 43% reduction in the risk of macular degeneration in those with the highest intake of carotenoids, especially lutein and zeaxanthin, compared to those with the lowest intake (45Trusted Source).\nPopcorn and other high-fiber foods were once believed to trigger this condition (47Trusted Source).\nMen who ate the most popcorn were 28% less likely to develop diverticular disease than those with the lowest intake (48Trusted Source).\nAs a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, corn may help maintain your eye health.\nWhile usually not a problem for people who follow a well-balanced diet, it may be a serious concern in developing countries where cereal grains and legumes are staple foods.\nThey occur in stored cereals worldwide, but adverse health effects have mostly been linked to the consumption of corn and corn products \u2014 especially among people who depend on corn as their main dietary staple (53).\nOne observational study in South Africa indicates that regular consumption of cornmeal may increase the risk of cancer of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (58Trusted Source).\nIn April 2004, 125 people died in Kenya from aflatoxin poisoning after eating homegrown corn that had been improperly stored (59Trusted Source).\nThe symptoms of gluten intolerance include fatigue, bloating, diarrhea, and weight loss (60Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that corn zein caused an inflammatory reaction in a subgroup of people with celiac disease.\nFor this reason, scientists have hypothesized that corn intake may, in rare cases, be the cause of persistent symptoms in some people with celiac disease (62Trusted Source).\nCorn has also been reported to be a symptom trigger in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or FODMAP intolerance (63Trusted Source).\nAs a good source of antioxidant carotenoids, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, yellow corn may promote eye health.\nIt\u2019s also a rich source of many vitamins and minerals.\nFor this reason, moderate consumption of whole-grain corn, such as popcorn or sweet corn, can be an excellent addition to a healthy diet.\nThough corn is undeniably a popular vegetable and cereal grain, you may wonder whether it's healthy.\nThis article reviews corn oil, including its nutrition, uses\u2026 High-fructose corn syrup has been linked to many serious health issues, including today's obesity epidemic.\nThis

ears of corn make their way to our plates.\nThe four main categories of corn are field, popcorn, sweet and ornamental.\nMiniature ears of corn, known as baby corn, can be used in appetizers, soups, chowders, stews and stir fry dishes.\nBaby corn is particularly popular in Thai and Chinese cooking.\nFresh corn on the cob is best if cooked as soon as possible after picking, but that\u2019s not always practical.\nOnce you have brought the corn home, place the ears in your refrigerator as soon as possible.\nOnce cooked, corn will stay good for three to five days in the refrigerator and 10 to 12 months in the freezer.\nIf you\u2019re accustomed to boiling your sweet corn, try a new cooking method.\nSweet corn on the grill can be a delicious addition to your meal.","2":"Corn is a starchy vegetable and cereal grain that has been eaten all over the world for centuries.\nHowever, the health benefits of corn are controversial \u2014 while it contains beneficial nutrients, it can also spike blood sugar levels.\nSweet corn that you eat off the cob is usually considered a vegetable in the culinary world, whereas the dry seeds that are used for popcorn are classified as whole grains.\nIt\u2019s eaten as sweet corn, popcorn, tortillas, polenta, chips, cornmeal, grits, oil and syrup and added to countless other foods and dishes.\nIt can be eaten whole as sweet corn or popcorn or processed into chips, oil and syrup.\nMost of the carbs in corn come from starch \u2014 which can quickly raise your blood sugar, depending on how much you eat.\nHowever, it\u2019s also high in fiber that can help balance your blood sugar levels (3Trusted Source, 6).\nDue to its impressive nutrient profile, most people can benefit from eating whole corn and popcorn as part of a balanced diet.\nOn the other hand, processed corn products may not be very nutritious, as refined oil, syrup and chips lose beneficial fiber and other nutrients during production.\nTherefore, regularly eating corn may promote eye health \u2014 especially for those who are at risk of AMD.\nBased on these limited results, eating corn and popcorn may promote gut health and prevent digestive diseases.\nCorn is loaded with plant compounds that are linked to a lower risk of eye diseases.\nEven more, the fiber in corn may provide a number of health benefits and reduce your risk of diverticular disease.\nPeople who have diabetes may need to limit their starchy carb intake, including corn.\nResearch specifically focusing on corn intake and diabetes is limited, but studies suggest that low-carb diets are more effective at managing diabetes (16Trusted Source).\nA study in 115 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes found that eating a diet with only 14% of calories coming from carbs resulted in more stable blood sugars and a reduced medication need compared to getting 53% of the daily calories from carbs (16Trusted Source).\nOne study found that the prevalence of diabetes was 20% higher in countries with easier access to high-fructose corn syrup, compared to areas where the syrup was not readily available (17Trusted Source).\nFinally, people who are trying to lose weight may want to limit their intake of starchy carbs from corn.\nCorn can spike your blood sugar and may contribute to weight gain when consumed in excess.\nCorn is one of the most genetically modified crops in the world.\nThe impact of modified corn and other crops on human health and environmental safety is one of the most widely debated topics in the field of nutrition.\nCurrent research on the safety of genetically modified corn for humans is limited and conflicting.\nMore research is needed to help consumers make an informed decision about eating genetically modified corn.\nWhile more research is needed, some studies suggest that modified crops may pose health risks to humans.\nCorn is rich in fiber and plant compounds that may aid digestive and eye health.\nWhole corn is high in various nutrients, especially fiber and antioxidants.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup has been linked to many serious health issues, including today's obesity epidemic.\nThis article takes a close look at grains and their health effects, both the good stuff and the\u2026 High-fructose corn syrup is seriously bad for your health, but it's being added to all sorts of
