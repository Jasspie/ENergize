known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nBuying seasonally reduces carbon emissions from hothouses (greenhouses).\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nBroccoli is a vegetable and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"Academia.edu no longer supports Internet Explorer.","2":"Another broccoli, broccoli rabe, does not produce a head and is used as a greens crop.\nThis publication will cover the production and marketing of sprouting broccoli.\nUnlike cauliflower, broccoli is a fairly new crop to American consumers.\nBroccoli was first grown commercially in California, and the first ice-packed crop was shipped east in 1924.\nHowever, broccoli did not become a crop of any significance in the United States until after World War II.\nThe United States is the world's largest producer of broccoli.\nMost of the broccoli harvested in the United States is sold as fresh produce.\nIn 2011, the United States produced more than 2 billion pounds of broccoli with a value of over $750 million on more than 130,000 acres.\nLeading broccoli-producing states are California (90 percent of the crop), Arizona, Texas, and Oregon.\nIn recent years, the northeastern United States produced more than 500 acres.\nBroccoli produced in the northeastern United States is usually available from June through October.\nSeveral marketing alternatives are available to the broccoli grower: wholesale marketing, produce auctions, cooperatives, local retailers, and roadside stands.\nProduction of less than one acre of many vegetable crops is typical for most growers.\nIn wholesale marketing, producers often contract with shippers to market and ship the broccoli for a predetermined price.\nIf you do not use a contractor and choose to ship your broccoli to a wholesale market yourself, your product will be subject to the greatest price fluctuations.\nMarketing cooperatives generally use a pooled cost and price, which spreads price fluctuations over all participating producers.\nLocal retailers are another possible market, but you must take the time to contact produce managers and provide good-quality broccoli when stores require it.\nFor more information on marketing, consult  Fruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Part-time Growers\u00a0.\nIf you grow broccoli on sandy soil, irrigation is important for optimum plant growth and proper main head and side shoot development.\nBecause broccoli is a cool-season crop, it generally is planted in the spring.\nBroccoli heads must be closed and tight (no yellow petals showing) to be considered good quality.\nWhile broccoli generally is transplanted in the spring, it can be sown directly from seed in late summer or early fall, when soil temperatures are in the high 60s and ambient air temperatures are in the 80s.\nSpacing decisions depend on the row spacing of your equipment, your ability to irrigate, the planting date, and your specific market requirements (small or large heads).\nInsects are a major potential problem in broccoli production.\nSeveral broccoli diseases can cause crop losses.\nMany of the pesticides required for broccoli production are restricted-use pesticides and require a pesticide applicator license to purchase.\nWhen using any pesticides in your enterprise, remember to follow all label recommendations regarding application rates and personal protection equipment (PPE) requirements.\nTo ensure marketing a high-quality product, you should check the broccoli heads for worms, which tend to hide underneath the florets.\nIn the normal course of operations, farmers handle pesticides and other chemicals, may have manure to collect and spread, and use equipment to prepare fields and harvest crops.\nContact your soil and water conservation district, extension office, zoning board, state departments of agriculture and environmental protection, and local governing authorities to determine what regulations may pertain to your operation.\nAlso, several major food distribution chains are beginning to require GAP- and GHP-certified products from their producers.\nYou will need to have any water supply used by your workers or for crop irrigation and pesticide application checked at least twice each year.\nFor more information about GAP and GHP programs, contact your local extension office or your state's department of agriculture.\nSecond, check to see if there are multi-peril crop insurance programs available for your crop or livestock enterprises.\nThere are crop insurance programs designed to help farmers manage both yield risk and revenue shortfalls.\nIf individual coverage is not available for what you grow, you may be able to use the AGR\/AGR-Lite program to insure the revenue of your entire farm operation.\nFor more information concerning crop insurance, contact a crop insurance agent or check the Penn State Extension website.\nFinally, the USDA Farm Service Agency has a program called the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP), which is designed to provide a minimal level of yield risk protection for producers of commercial agricultural products that don't have multi-peril crop insurance coverage.\nNAP coverage is available through your local USDA Farm Service Agency office.\nMore information on the use of crop budgets can be found in Enterprise Budget Analysis.\nThis publication was developed by the Small-scale and Part-time Farming Project at Penn State with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Extension Service."},"environment_urls":{"0":"healabel.com\/b-ingredients\/broccoli","1":"www.academia.edu\/48555870\/Effect_of_environmental_conditions_and_water_status_on_the_bioactive_compounds_of_broccoli","2":"extension.psu.edu\/broccoli-production"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

offer multiple health benefits, including reduced blood sugar, cholesterol levels, oxidative stress and chronic disease development.\nBroccoli also contains measurable amounts of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which may prevent oxidative stress and cellular damage in your eyes (8Trusted Source).\nA small human study in tobacco smokers also revealed that eating broccoli led to a significant reduction in markers of inflammation (11Trusted Source).\nCruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, contain various bioactive compounds that may reduce cell damage caused by certain chronic diseases (12Trusted Source).\nOne human study showed significantly decreased insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes who consumed broccoli sprouts daily for one month (19Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, an animal study revealed decreased blood sugar in addition to reduced pancreatic cell damage in diabetic rats fed broccoli extract (20Trusted Source).\nSome research also supports the notion that specific antioxidants in broccoli may reduce your overall risk of heart attack (7Trusted Source).\nA study in mice fed broccoli sprouts revealed a potentially protective effect against cell death and oxidative stress in heart tissue following a cardiac arrest (24Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, higher intake of fiber-rich foods like broccoli is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease (25Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Broccoli is rich in fiber and antioxidants \u2014 both of which may support healthy bowel function and digestive health.\nEating fiber- and antioxidant-rich foods like broccoli may play a role in maintaining healthy gut function (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nA study in mice on a broccoli diet found reduced levels of inflammation in the colon, as well as favorable changes in gut bacteria (29Trusted Source).\nA recent human study indicated that people who ate broccoli were able to defecate more easily than individuals in the control group (30Trusted Source).\nThough these results are promising, more human research is needed to better understand how broccoli affects digestive health.\nSome of the nutrients and bioactive compounds in broccoli may slow mental decline and support healthy brain and nervous tissue function.\nA study in 960 older adults revealed that one serving per day of dark green vegetables, such as broccoli, may help resist mental decline associated with aging (31Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, an animal study showed that mice treated with kaempferol \u2014 a compound in broccoli \u2014 had lowered incidence of brain injury and reduced inflammation of neural tissue following a stroke-like event (32Trusted Source).\nSulforaphane is another potent bioactive compound present in broccoli with the potential to support brain function after an event of reduced oxygenation to the brain.\nMost current research evaluating the effect of bioactive compounds found in broccoli on brain health are restricted to animal studies.\nResearch shows that sulforaphane, a key bioactive compound in broccoli, may have the capacity to slow the biochemical process of aging by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes (37Trusted Source).\nBroccoli contains a wide array of nutrients, some of which are known to support oral health and prevent dental diseases.\nBroccoli is a good source of vitamin C and calcium, two nutrients associated with a decreased risk of periodontal disease.\nAdditional research indicates that the sulforaphane found in broccoli may reduce your risk of oral cancers (41Trusted Source).\nMany of the nutrients found in broccoli are known to support healthy bones and may prevent bone-related disorders.\nBroccoli is a good source of vitamin K and calcium, two vital nutrients for maintaining strong, healthy bones (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nMore research is needed to better understand how broccoli and its bioactive compounds may support healthier pregnancy outcomes.\nResearch indicates that bioactive compounds in broccoli may protect against UV radiation damage which leads to skin cancer.\nSmall human studies have achieved similar results, revealing a significant protective effect of broccoli extract against skin damage and cancer development after sun exposure (49Trusted Source).\nUltimately, more research is needed to understand how broccoli and its bioactive components may protect skin from sun damage.\nBroccoli is a nutrient-rich vegetable that may enhance your health in a variety of ways, such as by reducing inflammation, improving blood sugar control, boosting immunity and promoting heart health.","1":"Broccoli is high in many nutrients, including fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, iron, and potassium.\nThis green veggie can be enjoyed both raw and cooked, but recent research shows that gentle steaming provides the most health benefits (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).\nRaw broccoli contains almost 90% water, 7% carbs, 3% protein, and almost no fat.\nOne cup (91 grams) of raw broccoli provides 2.3 grams of fiber, which is about 5\u201310% of the Daily Value (DV) (7Trusted Source).\nBroccoli is low in digestible carbs but provides a decent amount of fiber, which promotes gut health and may reduce your risk of various diseases.\nBroccoli is relatively high in protein, which makes up 29% of its dry weight, compared to most vegetables.\nHowever, because of its high water content, 1 cup (91 grams) of broccoli only provides 3 grams of protein.\nBroccoli is rich in various antioxidants and plant compounds, which contribute to its health benefits.\nThese include (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20): Broccoli is high in many plant compounds that have been associated with health benefits.\nCruciferous vegetables like broccoli provide sulfur-containing compounds that are responsible for their often pungent taste (21Trusted Source).\nA unique family of plant compounds called isothiocyanates sets cruciferous vegetables apart from other veggies.\nThe main isothiocyanate in broccoli, sulforaphane, acts against the formation of cancer at the molecular level by reducing oxidative stress (16Trusted Source, 30, 31Trusted Source).\nSulforaphane occurs at 20\u2013100 times higher amounts in young broccoli sprouts than in full-grown heads of this vegetable (32Trusted Source).\nThis effect has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and cancer (2Trusted Source).\nThis vegetable may thus boost eyesight in individuals with a low vitamin A intake.\nWhat\u2019s more, this vegetable may help lower cholesterol and boost eye health.\nCooking this vegetable on high heat can reduce these effects (40Trusted Source).\nIndividuals taking the blood thinner warfarin should consult with their healthcare practitioner before increasing their broccoli intake because its high vitamin K1 content may interact with this medication (41Trusted Source).\nIt is high in many nutrients, including a family of plant compounds called isothiocyanates, which may have numerous health benefits.\nIt is also a decent source of fiber and higher in protein than most other vegetables.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a health boost, consider adding this cruciferous vegetable to your diet today.\nSulforaphane is a natural plant compound found in many cruciferous vegetables like broccoli.\nCruciferous vegetables are low-calorie, and rich in folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and fiber.\nThis article examines the benefits and key differences of\u2026 Vegetables are a very important food group on a low-carb diet.","2":"It is low in calories but contains a wealth of nutrients and antioxidants that support many aspects of human health.\nBroccoli is a cruciferous vegetable, alongside kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, cabbage, collard greens, rutabaga, and turnips.\nIn this article, learn more about the nutritional content of broccoli, some possible health benefits, and some tips for cooking and serving it.\nBroccoli is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nAntioxidants can help prevent the development of various conditions.\nCruciferous vegetables contain a range of antioxidants, which may help prevent the type of cell damage that leads to cancer.\nSome scientistsTrusted Source have suggested that cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli may play a role in \u201cgreen chemoprevention,\u201d in which people use either the whole plant or extracts from it to help prevent cancer.\nVitamin K has a role in blood coagulation, but some experts have also suggested that it may help preventTrusted Source or treat osteoporosis.\nPeople with low vitamin K levels may be more likely to experience problems with bone formation.\nGetting enough vitamin K from the diet may help keep the bones healthy.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a cup of broccoli weighing around 76 gramsTrusted Source (g) contains 3% to 3.5% of a person\u2019s daily need for calcium, 45\u201354%Trusted Source of their daily need for vitamin C, and 64\u201386% of their daily need for vitamin K, depending on their age and sex.\nVitamin C is an antioxidant that providesTrusted Source a range of benefits.\nVitamin C helps the body produce collagen, which is the main support system for body cells and organs, including the skin.\nAs an antioxidant, vitamin C can also help preventTrusted Source skin damage, including wrinkling due to aging.\nDietary fiber can help promote regularity, prevent constipation, maintain a healthy digestive tract, and lower the risk of colon cancer.\nIn 2015, a screening trialTrusted Source found that people who consumed the highest levels of fiber were less likely to develop colorectal cancer than those who ate little fiber.\nScientists found that the antioxidant effect of sulforaphane in broccoli helped reduce inflammation markers in laboratory tests.\nResearch from 2017 suggested that eating broccoli may help people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels.\nAlso, one 2018 reviewTrusted Source found that people who consume a high fiber diet are less likely to have type 2 diabetes than those who eat little fiber.\nFiber may also help reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.\nThe fiber, potassium, and antioxidants in broccoli may help prevent CVD.\nThis benefit may be due to the antioxidant content of cruciferous vegetables, and particularly sulforaphane.\nOne 2017 reviewTrusted Source found that people who eat the most fiber have a lower risk of CVD and lower levels of blood lipids (fat) than those who consume little fiber.\nWhich foods can help prevent high blood pressure?\nBroccoli also contains various B vitamins, zinc, copper, selenium, and a range of antioxidants.\nLearn about some other antioxidant-rich foods here.\nBroccoli is a good source of vitamin K, but this may interfere with some people\u2019s use of blood-thinning drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin).\nPeople who use these drugs should not suddenly increase their intake of vitamin K-rich foods such as broccoli.\nAlso, some people may have an allergic reaction to the substances in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-broccoli","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/broccoli","2":"www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/266765"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
