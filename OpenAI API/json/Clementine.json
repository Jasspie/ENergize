Brebbia, Wessex Institute of Technology, UK Environmental Sustainability Of The Clementine Production Systems In Italy And Spain:.\nAlthough this is a complex task, since the environmental impact of agriculture depends not only on the production system (e.g. conventional or organic) and farmer practices, but also on the production site (soil and climate conditions).\nThe aim of this study is to assess the environmental impact of clementine production farming systems (conventional, CFS, and organic, OFS) in Italy (Calabria region) and Spain (Comunidad Valenciana) through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).\nNo significant differences were found between CFS and OFS in both countries and the impacts present a high variability depending on the farm.\nIn CFS the fertilizers production is the stage most impacting in almost all categories (Global Warming Potential: Italy 92% \u2013 Spain 89%; Acidification: Italy 91% \u2013 Spain 80%) with the exception for the Ecotoxicity in which field operations have a great contribution (Spain: 97%; Italy: 78%).\nThe main difference between Italian and Spanish organic farms arises in the Ecotoxicity category.\nIn Italy the stage with the greatest contribution is the production of fertilizers (87%), whereas in Spain it is the field operation (95%).","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.witpress.com\/Secure\/elibrary\/papers\/ECO15\/ECO15016FU1.pdf","1":"www.witpress.com\/elibrary\/wit-transactions-on-ecology-and-the-environment\/192\/34145","2":"www.eybna.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SDS-Clementine-US-en-1.pdf"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

diet.\nClementines are also a vitamin C powerhouse, with one small fruit providing 40% of your daily needs.\nVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and immune booster that can prevent cellular damage from harmful and unstable compounds called free radicals (2Trusted Source).\nThese vitamins perform many functions to keep your body working optimally, including helping prevent anemia and promoting a healthy metabolism (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nClementines are rich in antioxidants like vitamin C, which can help improve your skin\u2019s health and appearance.\nClementines are rich in antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation and prevent cellular damage caused by free radicals.\nAlong with vitamin C, these fruits contain a number of other citrus antioxidants, including hesperidin, narirutin, and beta carotene (2Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nAccording to some animal and test-tube studies, the citrus antioxidant hesperidin is highly anti-inflammatory, but more human research is needed (9Trusted Source).\nClementines are rich in vitamin C, which can improve skin health in a number of ways.\nThat means that getting plenty of vitamin C in your diet can help ensure your body makes enough collagen to keep your skin looking healthy and potentially younger, as adequate collagen levels can reduce the appearance of wrinkles (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nAlthough one clementine contains just 1 gram of fiber, snacking on a few throughout the day is an easy and delicious way to boost your fiber intake.\nFruit fiber may also help lower your cholesterol levels by binding with dietary cholesterol and preventing its absorption into your bloodstream (16Trusted Source).\nClementines are small, easy to peel, sweet, and usually seedless, making them a perfect snack for children.\nIn fact, most branded clementines are marketed toward young children and their parents as a way to boost fruit intake.\nBecause clementines are appealing to children \u2014 and usually inexpensive for their parents \u2014 they can help promote fruit intake and healthy eating habits from a young age.\nClementines are rich in antioxidants and fiber and can help improve your skin and gut health.\nIn addition, they may promote fruit intake among children.\nSome research has found that clementines contain furanocoumarins, a compound also found in grapefruit that can interact with certain heart medications (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nFor this reason, if you take statins, you should limit your intake of clementines (21Trusted Source).\nTalk to your healthcare provider about potential interactions between your medications and clementines (20Trusted Source).\nClementines may interfere with certain drugs, as similarly to grapefruit, they contain furanocoumarins.\nClementines are small, easy to peel, typically seedless, and sweet citrus fruits.\nAs such, they appeal to young children and can help encourage their fruit intake.\nIn addition, they\u2019re packed with health-boosting antioxidants like vitamin C and beta carotene.","1":"Small but powerful, clementines pack a punch with their strong flavor and impressive health benefits.\nThis citrus hybrid blends the best aspects of mandarin oranges and sweet oranges into a small, juicy fruit that is easy to peel.\nThis variety includes seeds and is larger and sweeter than seedless types.\nTheir small size, easily removed peel, and sweet flavor make clementines a popular choice for parents who encourage their children to eat plenty of fresh fruits.\nClementines contain high levels of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, which play an important role in reducing inflammation.\nDiets high in anti-inflammatory foods, like clementines, may reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.\nHigh fiber intake encourages healthy digestion by adding bulk to your stool and making it easier to pass.\nToo little vitamin C can lead to reduced levels of hydrochloric acid, which helps your body break down and absorb nutrients.\nResearch reveals that people who eat citrus fruits on a regular basis are less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration.\nWhile flavonoids can be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, the type found in clementines seems to be especially powerful for promoting healthy eyes.\nMany of the fruit\u2019s health benefits are due to its high vitamin C content.\nThis important vitamin helps with several key systems in your body, including your immune system.\nClementines are also rich in flavonoids\u2014plant compounds that can help reduce inflammation.\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition: \"Dietary Flavonoids and the Prevalence and 16-y Incidence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\" Duquesne University Center for Spiritan Studies: \"The Spiritan Connection to the Clementine Fruit.\" Harvard Women's Health Watch: \"Foods That Fight Inflammation.\" \u00a9 2005 -

thought of as \u201ctiny oranges\" (and sold with names like \"Cuties\" and \"Sweeties\").\nThe same serving also provides about 6.8 grams of sugar, but since clementines are naturally sweet, there are no added sugars.\nClementines, like most other citrus fruits, are low in protein.\nLike most citrus fruits, they\u2019re high in vitamin C.\nA single clementine provides 60% of the daily recommended intake of this important vitamin.\n(Men need 90 milligrams per day.)2\ufeff Clementines are also rich in potassium, providing 131\u00a0milligrams per serving of one fruit (to compare, a small banana has about 360 milligrams).\nThere are 36 micrograms in one clementine, or about 10% of the daily recommended value, for both women and men.3\ufeff Beta-cryptoxanthin is a carotenoid often found in fruits and vegetables that are red, orange (like clementines), or yellow in color.\nBeta-cryptoxanthin also acts as an\u00a0antioxidant.4\ufeff In addition to the nutrients clementines offer, there are a host of health effects they have as well.\nSome research also suggests vitamin C also has an effect on pneumonia.6\ufeff There are a number of published studies linking citrus fruit intake with a reduced risk of cancer.\nOne study found that eating citrus fruit reduced the risk of breast cancer by 10%.\nOther research has shown citrus fruit consumption protects against pancreatic, esophageal, and stomach cancer.7\ufeff The mechanism isn\u2019t fully understood\u2014one hypothesis is that the vitamin C in citrus fruits can deactivate carcinogens (cancer-causing agents).8\ufeff As we age, bones become more brittle because there is less formation of new bone as well as continuing resorption of existing bones.\nStudies have shown that beta-cryptoxanthin stimulates bone growth while also reducing bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass.9\ufeff Maintaining healthy skin goes beyond anti-aging and aesthetics.\nAnd our skin naturally contains high concentrations of vitamin C.\nThe vitamin acts as an antioxidant, protecting our skin from UV damage as well as stimulating collagen growth.10\ufeff Research also shows vitamin C is important for maintaining a healthy collagen\/elastin balance, which becomes more difficult to maintain as we age.\nThe vitamin plays a role in every stage of wound healing from reducing inflammation to collagen formation, and even reducing scar tissue.11\ufeff Hesperidin is a plant compound found in clementines that may play a role in cognitive health, along with vitamin C.\nThrough this mechanism, hesperidin may help keep the brain tissue healthy.12\ufeff Similar to how vitamin C is naturally found in high concentrations in our skin, it\u2019s also found concentrated in our brains and spinal fluid.\nThe exact role vitamin C plays with cognition is still unknown, but the nutrient may help protect our brains as they age, specifically in older adults with insufficient vitamin C intake.13\ufeff Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies among Americans, especially women ages 19 to 50 and adolescent girls.14\ufeff In our diet, there are two types of iron: heme (from animal sources) and non-heme (from plant sources).\nNon-heme iron is not absorbed as well as heme iron, but vitamin C is one nutrient that can help the process.\nEating foods rich in vitamin C while eating non-heme iron foods, such as a spinach salad with bell peppers, increases the non-heme iron absorption 3- to 6-fold.15\ufeff Although it is not one of the more common food allergies, citrus allergy does exist.\nThere are different components specifically within citrus fruits that may cause allergic reactions.\nIf you\u2019re allergic to citrus, you should discuss your restrictions with your doctor.16\ufeff Grapefruit, a member of the citrus family, is one of the most common foods to have interactions with drugs.\nSome fruit juices, including clementine juice, may also interact with medications.\nDiscuss these interactions with your doctor.17\ufeff Mandarins are a type of orange, but they are in a category of their own\u2014along with clementines and tangerines.\nThese fruits tend to have thin, easy-to-peel skin and are smaller in size compared to oranges.\nOunce-for-ounce, oranges, and clementines have about the same number of calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.\nThey only vary slightly when it comes to some nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, folate, calcium, and potassium, although the differences are not remarkable.18\ufeff Like most citrus fruits, clementines are in season during the winter months, November to February\u2014though you can often find them in supermarkets year-round.\nAlthough citrus fruits are not generally associated with food-borne illnesses, contamination is possible.\nNational Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements Vitamin C fact sheet for consumers.\nBeta-cryptoxanthin as a source of vitamin A.\nVitamin
