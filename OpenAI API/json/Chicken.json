eating chicken really better for the environment than eating beef? | Greenpeace UK"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"The chicken industry is committed to environmentally responsible and sustainable chicken production practices to ensure a healthier planet.\nFor the chicken industry, sustainability means being responsible stewards of land, water and feed management, and maintaining and advocating for the humane treatment of our most important asset: our chickens.\nThrough continuous innovation and by ensuring the best possible bird health, the chicken industry has been able to significantly reduce the use of water, farmland, electricity, greenhouse gasses, and other valuable resources.\nChicken production has a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other animal agriculture industry, and we are continuing to develop and advance our sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices so that we leave the earth in better shape than we found it.\nWe have made significant strides in minimizing environmental impact with the help of technological advancements and improved animal husbandry practices.\nGrowout houses, the barns where broiler chickens live and grow, are equipped with computer systems that measure and monitor water usage on the farm.\nYou may be surprised to learn that growing corn and soybeans for the production of chicken feed is the largest source of water consumption in chicken production.\nIn order to produce 1 pound of chicken, it only takes about 1.82 pounds of feed, one of the best rates in all of US animal agriculture.\nThat might not sound like a lot, but when you are feeding 9 billion chickens each year, that\u2019s a lot of land, water and emissions we are saving.\nAll of these factors result in chicken requiring less feed and water to grow to market weight which results in chicken having less of an environmental impact.\nNutrient Management Plans are generally required for all agricultural land used to produce plants, food, feed, fiber, animals or other agricultural products.\nThese Nutrient Management Plans protect water quality by ensuring that farmers and urban land managers apply fertilizers, animal manure and other nutrient sources in an effective and environmentally sound manner.\nFarmers also minimize water runoff and emissions by planting vegetative buffers between chicken houses, which help to absorb any water, dust or emissions on the farm.\nLitter that farmers do not immediately use is placed in a shed which further ensures that the litter does not enter local water sources.\nSome chicken farmers are also installing solar panels in order to limit their energy use.\nFor example, Terri Wolf-King installed solar panels on her farm to help lower their energy bill and decrease their environmental footprint.\nIn fact, chicken production is extremely local; the distance from the hatchery to the farm to the processing plant is usually no more than one hour away from one another.\nLocalized production between the hatchery, farm and processing plant reduces time traveled, emissions and costs.\nThe chicken industry remains committed to reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of natural resources and byproducts of poultry production that contribute to climate change.\nFor farmers, there are many solutions to help improve air quality on their farms and reduce ammonia.\nCertain levels of ammonia in the chicken house can be damaging to the chicken, the farmer and the environment.\nFor this reason, farmers use litter treatments to aid in the retention of ammonia in litter, as well as ventilation and monitors to ensure the health of their flock.\nThe broiler chicken industry is committed to meeting that rising demand for consumers, while ensuring we are using practices that lessen our environmental impact.\nThe chicken industry is continuously looking for new ways to reduce our use of natural resources and improve the sustainability of our practices \u2013 and we know that advancements in production technology should never come at the expense of the health of our birds or of the people we\u2019re feeding.\nWe are already headed in the right direction \u2013 chicken production has a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other animal agriculture industry, and we are continuing to develop and advance our sustainable practices so that we leave the earth in better shape than we found it.","1":"","2":"Eating chicken is thought to have less of an impact on the planet than eating beef.\nProducing soya to feed the billions of chickens eaten every year around the world has led to forest clearance on an epic scale, accelerating climate change and pushing wildlife into extinction.\nForests are destroyed to provide grazing land and grow soya to produce cattle feed, which releases huge amounts of carbon.\nThe animal feed industry is doing untold damage to many of Brazil\u2019s natural landscapes, including the Cerrado.\nSouth America\u2019s second largest forest, the Gran Chaco, is also being devastated by soya, as well as cattle ranching.\nBy destroying these natural landscapes, food companies are making a big contribution to the climate crisis, as well as threatening wild species with extinction.\nThe demand for cheaper animal products and, as a result, cheaper animal feed is encouraging the soya industry to push further into the Cerrado and Gran Chaco.\nSoya production in Brazil has ballooned \u2013 it produces four times as much as it did 20 years ago.\nMany people have shifted from eating beef to chicken as a more climate-friendly option.\nBut the sheer numbers of chickens eaten means they make a big contribution to climate change, along with the additional pollution generated by factory farming.\nThat also means less land will be needed for grazing and growing soya, leaving more space for forests and wildlife.\nTo meet climate change targets, global meat and dairy consumption will need to fall by 50% by 2030.\nThat means replacing 70% of the meat and dairy eaten in this country with plant-based options over the next 10 years.\nIf we\u2019re serious about tackling the climate and nature emergency then food companies and supermarkets need to start replacing the meat and dairy in their products with healthy, affordable plant-based foods."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.chickencheck.in\/faq\/sustainability\/","1":"www.biologicaldiversity.org\/takeextinctionoffyourplate\/pdfs\/ChickenFactsheet.pdf","2":"www.greenpeace.org.uk\/news\/is-eating-chicken-better-for-the-environment-than-beef\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

chicken breast, as it\u2019s the healthiest cut of the bird.\nA great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits: The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids.\nEating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.\nProtein rich meals can make us feel fuller despite us eating less, which helps to promote better weight management.\nA food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease.\nChicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the \u201cfeel good\u201d hormone) in our brains.\nChicken is filled with high-quality proteins and doesn\u2019t contain much fat \u2014 especially if you eat lean cuts.\nBeyond its rich protein content, chicken also contains: The USDA recommends limiting portion sizes of foods like chicken to between two and six and a half ounces of protein per day.\nIf you\u2019re on a low-cholesterol diet or at high risk for heart disease, pay close attention to the amount of cholesterol in the meat you buy.\nThere are several ways to thaw frozen chicken: Whichever method you use, do not leave your chicken in an environment over 40 degrees F when thawing, as bacteria can begin to grow on the meat.\nTo check, insert a food thermometer into the thickest part of whatever cut of chicken you\u2019re cooking.","1":"The following data, sourced from the USDA Food Composition Databases, displays the nutritional values per 100 grams of raw chicken.\nCreatine is a compound that the human body produces naturally from three amino acids; arginine, glycine, and methionine (5).\nResearch shows that we can expect to find around 850 mg of creatine per 200 gram serving of skinless chicken breast (7).\nFor example, 100 grams of chicken breast provides more than 23 grams of protein for only 110 calories (1).\nAlthough foods like bacon and fatty steak are delicious, they can\u2019t compete with chicken for protein density.\nSince chicken offers such a concentrated source of protein, it is an excellent dietary addition for anyone looking to increase their protein intake without consuming large amounts of extra calories.\nChicken provides a large amount of a compound called anserine.\nAnserine is a bioactive antioxidant compound found in a wide range of animal foods.\nHowever, anserine concentrates in muscle tissue, making chicken breast one of the very best sources (13).\nChicken meat contains a large amount of vitamin B3 (niacin), offering 56% of the RDI per 100 grams.\nWhile chicken is not quite as concentrated in B vitamins as red meat like beef and lamb, it is still a good source of them.\nGenerally speaking, the most concentrated sources of glycine include meat cuts from near the bone, skin, and connective tissues.\nTherefore, chicken thigh (including skin) is one of the very best dietary sources of glycine.\nNotably, research suggests that an optimal balance of methionine (found in muscle meat) and glycine may have longevity benefits.\nThe most concentrated mineral found in chicken meat is selenium.\nFurthermore, research suggests that sufficient selenium intake can help to increase blood antioxidant levels.\nChicken breast offers around 25% of the RDI for selenium per 100 grams (1).\nSince chicken meat is such a protein-dense food, it likely plays a beneficial role in improving levels of satiety.\nIn addition to its anserine content, chicken is also a good source of carnosine.\nInterestingly, existing research suggests that carnosine may have some useful health benefits, likely from its ability to bind excessive glucose in the blood (31).\nChicken breast contains close to 200 mg of carnosine per 100 grams (36).\nAs this article shows, chicken provides more nutritional benefits than many people believe.\nFirstly, it is high in protein, and it supplies a good range of vitamins and minerals.\nChicken meat also contains several bioactive compounds including anserine, carnosine, and creatine.\nWhile chicken isn\u2019t quite as nutrient-rich as red meat, nutritionally it still has a lot to offer.\nSalmon and chicken are certainly good sources of protein.\nHowever, unlike you, I rarely eat the chicken without the skin \u2013 it\u2019s just too tasty\u2026 Nutrition Advance provides evidence-based food and nutrition articles.","2":"Although there are still many threats from chicken, it cannot be denied that chicken has a lot of health benefits such as maintaining suitable weight, providing essential nutrients to the body, and helping to deal with some health problems.\nIn the article today, I would like to show you and other readers some of the best health benefits of chicken for human beings.\nThe first one of the best health benefits of chicken I would like to show you today is that chicken is an excellent source of protein.\nThe amount of protein in chicken flesh can help you grow and develop muscle, maintaining a healthy body weight and support the weight loss program.\nChicken is actually among the best and \u201ccleanest\u201d source of protein.\nChicken contains a very high amount of protein and less saturated fat than red meat.\nThe protein-richness of chicken makes it a good choice for health\u00a0and muscle.\nIn fact, if you feel depressed, you just need to eat some food dishes which are mainly made with chicken to increase the levels of serotonin in your brain, in order to enhance your mood, reduce and ease the stress, and relieve the depression that you are suffering.\nIn fact, large quantities of vitamin B3 contained in chicken can help people improve mood effectively, especially in cold winter days.\nThis is actually one of the best health benefits of chicken that not many people know!\nAnd fortunately, eating chicken breast in a regular basis may help to prevent the increase of homocysteine levels and control them as you desire.\nChicken has cholesterol but it also contains niacin which can help to lower the cholesterol levels.\nThis is actually one of the most well-known and best nutritional benefits of chicken that everyone should know and make use of to improve skin condition without using expensive cosmetics and harmful drugs or pills.\nNiacin, also known as vitamin B3, is found at high levels in meat and poultry, especially in chicken.\nVitamin B3 also has been proven to have positive effects on cholesterol lowering, so it is believed to have positive influences on reducing the risks of heart diseases in people who are living with high cholesterol levels.\nChicken contains 74% of the daily consumption of vitamin B3 for men and 84% for women.\nThis is actually one of the best health benefits of eating chicken that people should know and make use of to improve the overall health for good!\nPyridoxine, also known as Vitamin B6, which is found in chicken, can support the metabolic process of carbohydrates and protein.\nOne serving of chicken contains 40% of your daily recommended consumption of vitamin B6.\nChicken meat, so that, can help to maintain healthy weight effectively."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-chicken","1":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/chicken-meat-nutrition-benefits\/","2":"vkool.com\/benefits-of-chicken\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
