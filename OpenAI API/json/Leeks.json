PINK, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 Leek is a self-compatible outbreeding tetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) belonging to the diverse species complex Allium ampeloprasum L., which includes wild and cultivated forms with ploidy levels of 4x, 5x, and 6x, tetraploidy being the most common.\nIts tolerance of low temperatures together with the absence of photoperiod requirements or a bulb resting stage make leek extremely adaptable, and it is grown as a vegetable crop worldwide.\nThe objectives for leek breeding in the UK are the improvement of winter-hardiness, resistance to bolting, dark-green leaf blade (\u201cflag\u201d) color, and resistance to leek rust.\nIn addition to these improvements in quality, breeders also aim for improvement in yields, and European breeders have been concerned to obtain resistance to leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV).\nLong shaft length is desirable, particularly for processing, and improvement in uniformity is also important as variability in size is a major limiting factor in the marketability of the crop.\nG.P.F. Lane, in Lockhart & Wiseman\u2019s Crop Husbandry Including Grassland (Ninth Edition), 2014 Leeks can be harvested by hand or machine.\nRoots need trimming back but care is needed not to damage the base plate of the leek.\nampeloprasum var porrum (L.) Gay) are related to garlic and bear a resemblance to onions, shallots and scallions.\nLeeks look like large scallions, having a very small bulb and a long white cylindrical stalk of superimposed layers that flows into green, tightly wrapped, flat leaves.\nLeeks look like large scallions, having a very small bulb and a long white cylindrical stalk of superimposed layers that flows into green, tightly wrapped, flat leaves.\nCultivated leeks are usually about 30 cm in length and 5.0\u20138.5 cm in diameter, and feature a fragrant flavour that is reminiscent of shallots but sweeter and more subtle.\nLeek plants resemble large onion plants with flat leaves.\nUnlike onion and garlic, leeks do not form bulbs or produce cloves.\nLeeks are made up of sheaths of basal leaves that can be 15\u201325 cm long and 5 cm in diameter.\nThe taste of leeks is milder than those of onion and garlic.\nThe leek is a tall, hardy, biennial with white, narrowly ovoid bulbs and broad leaves.\nMany cultivars selected for long, white, edible bases and green tops, winter hardiness, and resistance to bolting are available for cultivation.\nThese cultivars differ from one another mainly in length and diameter of the sheath part, leaf spacing, breadth and colour of leaf blades, vigour and bolting, and resistance to cold.\nResistance to cold is of special importance where leeks are to be harvested throughout the winter, while slowness to bolt permits a prolonged harvest period in the spring (McCollum, 1976).\nRather than forming a tight bulb such as the onion, the leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths which are generally blanched by pushing soil around them (trenching).\nOnce established in the garden leeks are hardy; many varieties can be left in the ground during the winter to be harvested as needed (Anon, 2005a).\nLeek was an important vegetable for the Greeks and Romans, and its use later spread throughout medieval Europe.\nToday, leeks are an important vegetable in many northern European cuisines and are grown in many European countries (Anon, 2005a).\nS. Jain, in Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003 Leek varieties have been classified into a number of major types that differ in pseudostem length and slenderness, leaf color, winter hardiness, and the tendency for bulbiness.\nLonga: very long, high-yielding leeks with pale green leaves and little frost resistance.\nKing Richard: long, high-yielding types with pale to mid-green leaves, suitable for late summer production and frost-susceptible.\nPancho: long leek with mid-green leaves, limited frost resistance, and a tendency to form bulb.\nTilina: medium to long leaves, with pale to mid-green, rather spreading leaves, frost-resistant.\nVerina: medium shank length, dark leaf varieties, tendency to form bulb.\nGoliath: medium shank length, mid-green, spreading leaves, little bulbing, very frost-hardy, high-yielding.\nBleu Star: short leeks with dark leaves and a high degree of bulbiness, very hardy, low-yielding.\nThe leaves are dark green with white stems.\nPancho is considered an early leek, has thick white shanks, and resists bulbing.\nAmerican Flag is very hardy and cold-resistant, and has large, thick shanks; it blanches to clear white with blue-green leaves.\nCompared to onion, leek contains more protein and minerals.\nThe energy value of 100\u00a0g of edible portion of leek is also higher than that of onion.\nLeeks are harvested when their stalks reach a size of 2.5\u00a0cm or more in diameter and are tenderer.\nFanny Ribarova, in Diet, Microbiome and Health, 2018 Leek and three varieties of onions: white, red, and green (fresh) were investigated.\nAnalysis was conducted separately on the feathers, the white part of the stem, and on the whole vegetable to study the accumulation of flavonols in different parts of the plant in more detail.\nRed onions contain the highest amounts of quercetin among all tested vegetables with an average of 45.25\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g and maximum of 83.22\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g.\nIn onions, similar to other fruits and vegetables, quercetin is mostly accumulated in the outer layers of the bulb.\nWe have found that spring onion leaves contains quercetin (3.02\u20136.11\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g) and kaempferol (2.74\u20135.23\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g) and the white part of the onion has large amounts of quercetin (11.02\u201323.05\u00a0mg\/100\u00a0g).\nSimilar to the results for green onions, kaempferol in leeks is detected only in the green part of the stem, but unlike fresh onions, quercetin in leeks is detected neither in the green nor in the white part of the plant stem.\nTo properly peel the skin, the border plate between stalk and root must be cut.\nFor this reason, a machine vision system that enables the precise detection of the position of the border plate between stalk and root in leeks is a key technology for leek peeling.\nAn image of a leek root just before cutting at the plate between stalk and roots.\nOperators manually feed leeks onto the line of preprocessing machines, and once the position of the border plate is determined, the leeks are cut to a length of 60\u00a0cm.\nThe monochrome cameras indicate the position of the border plate, while the color cameras detect the border between green leaves and white stalk for the third step.\nIn the third step, the positions of the leeks on the line are adjusted so that the borders between green leaves and white stalks match with the positions of installed air nozzles.\nAfter peeling, several cameras inspect the length, width and bend of the white stalk as well as the number of leaves.\nARMSTRONG, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 The three recognized species of leek rust (Puccinia allii, P.\nfistulosum, onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) being one of the most important.\nAbe, in Using Cereal Science and Technology for the Benefit of Consumers, 2005 The Welsh onion, scallion and leek were farm-cultivated (Yahiro Sangyo Co. in Gifu, Japan), and powders were prepared using a vacuum dehydrator with a balance chamber drying system (Yahiro Sangyo).\nAllium powder such as Welsh onion, scallion and leek was blended with wheat flour; the substitution levels are indicated in Table 1.\nWelsh onion (1%), scallion (5.0%) and leek (0.5%) powder, and Pro2S2 (0.1%) and Me2S2 (6.3 mg%) were blended with wheat flour, respectively.\nM.G. Jones, in Fruit and Vegetable Flavour, 2008 Onions and garlic, along with leeks, spring onions (A.\ncepa), are used in cooking worldwide and onions are the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes (Griffiths et al., 2002).\nThe excellent storage properties of onion and garlic mean that they have been traded worldwide for longer than other vegetables.","1":"","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/agricultural-and-biological-sciences\/leeks","1":"plantvillage.psu.edu\/topics\/leek\/infos","2":"www.diethealthclub.com\/health-food\/leeks.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

proof of these health benefits of leeks will depend upon future studies with humans.\nPlants of the allium family may have a connection with a lower risk of certain cancers.\nOne analysis of 16 studies found that all vegetables in the allium family offer these health benefits.\nLeeks are rich in Vitamin K, which may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.\nBecause leeks are a low-calorie food, they can be part of a weight management program.\nLeeks also add a lot of flavor to foods and make eating healthy dishes enjoyable.\nAs a result, you must clean leeks carefully to avoid getting dirt in your food.\nHere are some ways to use them: BBC: \"The leek, national symbol of Wales.\" Food and Nutrition: \"Leeks: This Onion Cousin Delivers Unique Textures and Delicate Flavors.\" Journal of Nutritional Science: \"Flavonoids: an overview.\" Molecular Nutrition and Food Research: Colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps in relation to allium vegetables intake: a meta-analysis of

Source).\nMeanwhile, wild ramps are particularly rich in vitamin C, which aids immune health, tissue repair, iron absorption, and collagen production.\nLeeks are also a good source of manganese, which may help reduce premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and promote thyroid health.\nLeeks are a particularly great source of kaempferol, a polyphenol antioxidant thought to protect against heart disease and some types of cancer (9, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nThey\u2019re likewise a great source of allicin, the same beneficial sulfur compound that gives garlic its antimicrobial, cholesterol-lowering, and potential anticancer properties (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, wild ramps are rich in thiosulfinates and cepaenes, two sulfur compounds needed for blood clotting and thought to protect against certain types of cancer (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16).\nSeveral studies link alliums to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke (17Trusted Source).\nWhile most of these studies have tested onions or garlic, leeks contain several beneficial compounds thought to lower inflammation and protect heart health (18).\nKaempferol-rich foods are associated with a lower risk of heart attacks or death due to heart disease (10Trusted Source).\nMoreover, leeks are a good source of allicin and other thiosulfinates, which are sulfur compounds that may benefit heart health by reducing cholesterol, blood pressure, and the formation of blood clots (13Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, leeks are a good source of water and fiber, which may prevent hunger, promote feelings of fullness, and help you naturally eat less (21Trusted Source).\nThey also provide soluble fiber, which forms a gel in your gut and is particularly effective at reducing hunger and appetite (22Trusted Source).\nAdding leeks or wild ramps to your diet can boost your overall vegetable intake, which may increase this effect (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nLeeks are also a good source of allicin, a sulfur compound thought to offer similar anticancer properties (26).\nAnimal studies reveal that ramps grown in selenium-enriched soil may help lower cancer rates in rats (27Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, human studies demonstrate that those who regularly consume alliums, including leeks, may have up to a 46% lower risk of gastric cancer than those who rarely eat them (28Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, high intake of alliums may be linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nThat\u2019s in part because they\u2019re a source of soluble fiber, including prebiotics, which work to keep your gut healthy (31Trusted Source).\nSCFAs can reduce inflammation and strengthen your gut health (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that a prebiotic-rich diet may aid your body\u2019s absorption of important nutrients, which can boost your overall health (34Trusted Source).\nAlthough leeks aren\u2019t studied as rigorously as onions and garlic, emerging research suggests that they may offer additional benefits.\nLeeks and wild ramps boast a variety of nutrients and beneficial compounds that may improve your digestion, promote weight loss, reduce inflammation, fight heart disease, and combat cancer.","2":"These vegetables are not only nutritious, but they also have a delicious flavor and help to enhance the taste of various dishes.\nThis article provides a guide to leeks and their nutritional values, potential health benefits, and how to use them.\nPer 3.5 oz (100-gram) serving, they provide the following vitamin content (1, 2): As shown, leeks are an excellent source of vitamin K, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin C.\nVitamin K is necessary for the formation of prothrombin, a type of protein that plays an essential role in coagulation (clotting), which helps the body to heal from wounds.\nSimilar to other vegetables in this group, leeks contain organosulfur compounds (11).\nSulfur is currently classed as a non-essential mineral, but like other non-essential compounds, it may offer health benefits (12).\nOn this note, a variety of studies have demonstrated that organosulfur compounds play a regulatory role in enzymes that both detoxify and activate carcinogens (11, 13, 14).\nIn research relating specifically to leeks, a case-control study featuring 285 women found that a higher intake of leeks was significantly associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (15).\nFurthermore, numerous observational studies find an association between Allium vegetable intake and reduced risk of several different cancers (11, 16, 17, 18, 19).\nFurther human research is necessary to examine the relationship between Allium vegetables and cancer risk more clearly.\nHowever, there is currently no relevant human research on a high dietary intake of quercetin and kaempferol from plants, so more research is necessary to determine whether there is any benefit (24).\nResearch has also shown that quercetin and kaempferol have anti-cancer effects in studies using human cells (26, 27).\nAlthough dietary kaempferol and quercetin may have benefits, there is no human clinical research to suggest either can prevent or treat cancer (26).\nCarotenoids are a class of phytonutrients that are precursors to vitamin A, which is why they are sometimes referred to as \u2018provitamin A.\u2019 Leeks are a particularly rich source of a carotenoid called lutein, and data shows that they provide 36.8 mcg of this carotenoid per gram (22).\nSauteed leeks have a delicious flavor, and they make an excellent side to any meat, fish, or protein-based food.\nLeeks contain a beneficial range of vitamins and minerals.\nFurthermore, their content of organosulfur compounds, polyphenols, and carotenoids may potentially offer further benefits.\nSince leeks also taste delicious and contribute large amounts of flavor to food, they\u2019re an excellent addition to any diet."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-leeks","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/leek-benefits","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/leeks-nutrition-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"\n","1":"
