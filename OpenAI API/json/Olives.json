Impact of Olive Oil Processing Wastes | EcoMENA"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"","1":"","2":"The olive oil industry offers valuable opportunities to farmers in terms of seasonal employment as well as significant employment to the off-farm milling and processing industry.\nThe two byproducts produced by the three-phase system are a solid residue known as olive press cake (OPC) and large amounts of aqueous liquid known as olive mill wastewater (OMW).\nThe three-phase process usually yields 20% olive oil, 30% OPC waste, and 50% OMW.\nMore contemporary is the two-phase system, in this system \u201cthe volume of OMW produced is reduced because less water is used and much of that water and toxic substances are held within the solid olive cake, thus producing a semi-solid residue (SOR).\u201d\u00a0While the two-phase system produces less OMW, the SOR it produces has a \u201chigh organic matter concentration giving an elevated polluting load and it cannot be easily handled by traditional technology which deals with the conventional three-phase olive cake.\u201d Regardless of system used, the effluents produced from olive oil production exhibit highly phytotoxic and antimicrobial properties, mainly due to phenols.\nTroublingly, there is no general policy for disposal of this waste in the olive oil producing nations around the world.\nMoreover, due to its complex compounds, olive processing waste (OPW) is not easily biodegradable and needs to be detoxified before it can properly be used in agricultural and other industrial processes.\nThis poses a serious problem when the sophisticated treatment and detoxification solutions needed are too expensive for developing countries in MENA such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia where it is common for OMW to be dumped into rivers and lakes or used for farming irrigation.\nIn less developed countries where olive processing wastes\u00a0is disposed of, this waste, as well as olive processing cake and SOR waste is commonly unloaded and spread across the surrounding lands where it sits building up throughout the olive oil production season.\nEven a small quantity of olive wastewater in contact with groundwater has the potential to cause significant pollution to drinking water sources.\nThe problems associated with olive processing wastes\u00a0have been extensively studied for the past 50 years.\nResearch has also been done on using the semisolid waste generated from olive oil production to absorb oil from hazardous oil spills.\nAt the present state of olive mill wastewater\u00a0treatment technology, industry has shown little interest in supporting any traditional process (physical, chemical, thermal or biological) on a wide scale.This is because of the high investment and operational costs, the short duration of the production period (3-5 months) and the small size of the olive mills.\nOverall, the problems associated with olive processing wastes are further exemplified by lack of common policy among the olive oil producing regions, funding and infrastructure for proper treatment and disposal, and a general lack of education on the environmental and health effects caused by olive processing wastes.\nGiven the severity of environmental impact of olive processing wastes, it is imperative on policy-makers and industry leaders to undertake more concrete initiatives to develop a sustainable framework to tackle the problem of olive oil waste disposal.\nTreatment technologies of liquid and solid wastes from two-phase olive oil

diet.\nIn the Mediterranean region, 90% of olives are used to make olive oil (2Trusted Source).\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of ripe, canned olives are (3Trusted Source): Olives contain 11\u201315% fat, 74% percent of which is oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid.\nOleic acid is linked to several health benefits, including decreased inflammation and a reduced risk of heart disease.\nOlives are an unusual fruit because of their high fat content.\nTheir most abundant fat is oleic acid, which may have several health benefits.\nThe lowest levels of bitter compounds are found in ripe, black olives (13Trusted Source, 20).\nFresh olives are very bitter and usually need to be cured and fermented before eating.\nDietary antioxidants have been shown to reduce your risk of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\nOlives are rich in antioxidants, with health benefits ranging from fighting inflammation to reducing microorganism growth (23Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that eating a pulpy residue from olives significantly increased blood levels of glutathione, one of the most powerful antioxidants in your body (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nOleic acid, the main fatty acid in olives, is associated with improved heart health.\nFurthermore, some studies note that olives and olive oil may reduce blood pressure (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nThe rates of osteoporosis are lower in Mediterranean countries than in the rest of Europe, leading to speculation that olives might protect against this condition (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nSome of the plant compounds found in olives and olive oil have been shown to help prevent bone loss in animal studies (30Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nWhile human studies are lacking, animal studies and the data linking the Mediterranean diet to decreased fracture rates are promising (31Trusted Source).\nOlives and olive oil are commonly consumed in the Mediterranean region, where rates of cancer and other chronic diseases are lower than in other Western countries (35Trusted Source).\nThus, it\u2019s possible that olives may help reduce your risk of cancer.\nThis may be partly due to their high antioxidant and oleic acid contents.\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear whether eating olives or olive oil has any effect on cancer.\nOlives are very rich in antioxidants that may contribute to a variety of benefits, such as lower cholesterol and blood pressure.\nConsuming a high quantity of heavy metals may harm your health and increase your risk of cancer.\nAcrylamide is linked to an increased risk of cancer in some studies, although other scientists question the connection (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\nSome olive varieties \u2014 especially ripe, California black olives \u2014 may contain high amounts of acrylamide as a result of processing (45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).\nThey\u2019re low in carbs but high in healthy fats.\nThey\u2019re also linked to several health benefits, including improved heart health.\nExtra virgin olive oil is loaded with antioxidants and healthy fats and has been shown to offer numerous health benefits.\nThis article explains why\u2026 While an olive fruit or olive oil allergy is rare, it is possible.","1":"The vitamins and antioxidants found in olives may provide important health benefits.\nNumerous studies have shown that consuming olive oil, especially the extra-virgin variety, may reduce the risk of heart disease and mortality in people who have a high risk of this condition.\nOlives contain the compound oleocanthal, which studies have shown can kill cancer cells.\nOther studies have shown a link between consuming olive oil and reducing the risk of cancers, including breast cancer.\nThe oleocanthal in olives and olive oil is linked to a reduced risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other brain-related diseases.\nResearch shows a link between consuming olive oil and preventing type 2 diabetes by helping the body regulate glucose (sugar).\nOlives are rich in vitamin E and other antioxidants, which may help reduce the risk of health conditions like cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.\nOlives provide many health benefits, but they are still relatively high in fat.\nCanned olives are often packed in brine, which makes them high in sodium (salt).","2":"Known mostly for making versatile, benefit-rich olive oil, olives are bursting with rich phytonutrients and are known for their high vitamin E content, cancer-fighting antioxidants and cardiovascular benefits.\nNative to the Mediterranean regions of Asia, Europe and Africa, olives come in many sizes and varieties, and offer a number of great health benefits.\nThe diet doesn\u2019t encourage reducing fats, but rather replacing unhealthy fats with healthy ones like monounsaturated fats, which are found in olives.\nOlives are a high-antioxidant food that mainly provide polyphenols, which are antioxidants that have proven anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-aging and neuro-protective effects (1,\u00a02).\nOlives even help boost blood levels of glutathione, which is one of the body\u2019s most important antioxidant nutrients because of it\u2019s ability to recycle antioxidants.\nThe benefits from antioxidants like those found in olives transcend almost all body systems and can be a major factor in disease prevention and treatment.\nThe hypotensive (lowering blood pressure) effects of olives are due to the oleic acid they contain.\n(4) Studies have shown significant decreases in blood pressure and overall cardiovascular inflammation after consumption of olives, olive oil and other food items in the Mediterranean diet.\n(6) Inflammation also plays a large role in cardiovascular disease, which is another reason olives are heart-healthy.\n(7, 8) There is promising evidence that olives are some of the best cancer-fighting foods around.\nOlives nutrition has\u00a0all of the things needed for a healthy heart and cardiovascular system: antioxidants, anti-inflammatory capabilities, healthy fats, as well as a great supply of copper and Vitamin E, both of which\u00a0are important for optimum heart health.\nA diet containing olives can not only treat symptoms of heart disease, but it has also been proven to significantly reduce the risk of heart-related complications, even in individuals with genetic predisposition to high blood pressure and heart problems.\n(9, 10) Olives nutrition can also help prevent coronary heart disease.\n(11) A review of studies published in the\u00a0European Journal of Nutrition\u00a0showed\u00a0that the phenolic compounds in olives can increase the number of good bifidobacteria, which produce vitamins and antibacterial chemicals in the body.\n(12) Because olives are high in monounsaturated fats, they greatly reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity when substituted for foods containing other, more harmful fats.\n(13) A review published in\u00a0The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition studied the effects of olive oil consumption\u00a0on type II diabetes incidence.\nThis shows olives nutrition has the potential to treat obesity naturally.\n(15) Many studies show how effective olives are in fighting off certain microbial, viral and fungal infections.\nOlives are a low-calorie snack option and great added ingredient to scores of dishes like salads, pastas and pizza.\nAs a high-sodium food, you might ask, \u201cAre olives really good for you?\u201d With a serving this large (100 grams), the sodium content is high (1,556 milligrams per 100 grams or 65 percent DV), and it can be high in many varieties because of the curing process.\nIt\u2019s important to keep an eye on sodium content if and when that information is available, as some olives are cured differently than others.\nAlthough the fat content in olives is also high, it\u2019s primarily \u201cgood fat.\u201d Olives provide monounsaturated fatty acids, and more specifically oleic acid, which is linked with a number of health benefits like lowering inflammation and helping fight heart disease.\n(20) The fats found in olives and the Mediterranean diet are a great substitute for harmful fats.\nOlive fruit with the highest phenolic content include Cornicabra, Coratina, Moraiolo and Koroneiki.\nBlack olives, which have the highest oil content but the lowest phenolic levels, typically come in cans and are a popular toppings for pizzas and dips.\nIf the information is available, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on sodium levels, as some olives have higher sodium levels due to processing."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/olives","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-olives","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/olives-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
