by major shipping points, the majority of onions arriving in Chicago (the closest analyzed city to Milwaukee) from within the United States in 1998 came from Oregon (211,000 cwt).\nInternationally, the United States receives large numbers of onions from Mexico (502,795,759), Peru (158,325,008) and Canada (94,362,405) using 2010 statistics (Fereira, 2011).\nJalapeno peppers in the United States primarily come from Mexico (8,038,496), Peru (1,027,373) and Chile (490,967).\nWorldwide analysis of green bell and chile pepper harvest in 2007 shows that in terms of area harvested, China (653,200,000 hectares), Indonesia (190,000,000 hectares) and Mexico (93,000,000 hectares) have the largest harvests (Fereira, 2008).\nWithin Mexico specifically, the largest crop of jalapenos is located in Chihuahua.\nThe 3rd largest crop of jalapenos in Mexico is from the Chiapas region (Consolidated Mills Inc.).\nAfter more than 30 years of research, Oregon State University has improved onion crops to the extent that some are considered \u2018super colossal\u2019 onions.\nGroundwater quality has noticeably improved since the implementation of new onion planting techniques in Oregon, the United State\u2019s second largest producer of onions.\nIn this way, though there remains an impact on resources like water, soil, and ecosystem, farmers and researchers are investing in farming techniques that will lessen impacts- as can be seen with onions in Oregon.\nProduction of onions appears to produce the least carbon footprint (-0.52) as compared to all the other vegetables collected, followed by potatoes (-0.48) and carrots (-0.45) using the coefficients determined in a study by the University of Naples Federico II (Caracciolo et al, 2012).\nThese impacts are local, specifically in regards to onions, because from planting through purchase food production does have environmental impacts.\nPlanting and harvesting can affect water in soil quality in an area, so my purchasing of onions will contribute to that impact within the United States.\nThe biggest local impact is going to be where the food product originated (was planted and harvested) and the destination where it is packaged, sold and consumed.\nMy analysis showed that onions are likely from within Wisconsin or other parts of the United States (like Washington or Oregon).\nRetrieved from

once digested Water footprint: low, 272 liters of water used to produce 1 kilogram of onions \/ 33 gallons of water used to produce 1 pound of onions, onions have a relatively low water footprintCarbon footprint: low, 0.5 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of onions, a car driving equivalent of 1.25 miles or 2 kilometers, UK market data, onions have a relatively low carbon footprintDestruction: low, onion production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nBuying seasonally reduces carbon emissions from hothouses (greenhouses).\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nOnions are a vegetable and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair

Nutrition Facts and Health Effects"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"These vegetables contain various vitamins, minerals and potent plant compounds that have been shown to promote health in many ways.\nOnions are also rich in B vitamins, including folate (B9) and pyridoxine (B6) \u2014 which play key roles in metabolism, red blood cell production and nerve function (4Trusted Source).\nOnions contain antioxidants and compounds that fight inflammation, decrease triglycerides and reduce cholesterol levels \u2014 all of which may lower heart disease risk.\nSince it\u2019s a potent anti-inflammatory, it may help decrease heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure.\nA study in 70 overweight people with high blood pressure found that a dose of 162 mg per day of quercetin-rich onion extract significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 3\u20136 mmHg compared to a placebo (7Trusted Source).\nA study in 54 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) found that consuming large amounts of raw red onions (40\u201350 grams\/day if overweight and 50\u201360 grams\/day if obese) for eight weeks reduced total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol compared to a control group (8Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, evidence from animal studies supports that onion consumption may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including inflammation, high triglyceride levels and blood clot formation (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nMultiple population studies have found that people who consume more foods rich in anthocyanins have a reduced risk of heart disease.\nFor example, a study in 43,880 men showed that habitual intakes as high as 613 mg per day of anthocyanins were correlated to a 14% lower risk of nonfatal heart attacks (13Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, a study in 93,600 women observed that those with the highest intake of anthocyanin-rich foods were 32% less likely to experience a heart attack than women with the lowest intake 14Trusted Source).\nEating vegetables of the Allium genus like garlic and onions has been linked to a lower risk of certain cancers, including stomach and colorectal.\nA review of 26 studies showed that people who consumed the highest amount of allium vegetables were 22% less likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer than those who consumed the least amount (17Trusted Source).\nMoreover, a review of 16 studies in 13,333 people demonstrated that participants with the highest onion intake had a 15% reduced risk of colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest intake (18Trusted Source).\nThese cancer-fighting properties have been linked to the sulfur compounds and flavonoid antioxidants found in allium vegetables.\nFor example, onions provide onionin A, a sulfur-containing compound that has been shown to decrease tumor development and slow the spread of ovarian and lung cancer in test-tube studies (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nA study in 42 people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that eating 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of fresh red onion reduced fasting blood sugar levels by about 40 mg\/dl after four hours (23Trusted Source).\nA study showed that diabetic rats fed food containing 5% onion extract for 28 days experienced decreased fasting blood sugar and had substantially lower body fat than the control group (24Trusted Source).\nFor example, quercetin has been shown to interact with cells in the small intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, fat tissue and liver to control whole-body blood sugar regulation (25Trusted Source).\nA study in 24 middle-aged and postmenopausal women showed that those who consumed 3.4 ounces (100 ml) of onion juice daily for eight weeks had improved bone mineral density and antioxidant activity compared to a control group (26Trusted Source).\nPlus, the study demonstrated that older women who most frequently ate onions decreased their risk of hip fracture by more than 20% compared to those who never ate them (27Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s believed that onions help reduce oxidative stress, boost antioxidant levels and decrease bone loss, which may prevent osteoporosis and boost bone density (28Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, onion extract has been shown to inhibit the growth of Vibrio cholerae, a bacteria that is a major public health concern in the developing world (30Trusted Source).\nResearch has shown that these short-chain fatty acids strengthen gut health, boost immunity, reduce inflammation and enhance digestion (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, consuming foods rich in prebiotics helps increase probiotics, such as Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria strains, which benefit digestive health (37Trusted Source).\nA diet rich in prebiotics may help improve the absorption of important minerals like calcium, which may improve bone health (38Trusted Source).\nThese help increase the number of friendly bacteria in your gut and improve immune function (39Trusted Source).\nThese nutrient-packed vegetables contain powerful compounds that may decrease your risk of heart disease and certain cancers.","1":"Onions are among the richest food sources of a nutrient called quercetin, which is known to prohibit the activity or creation of cancer-causing elements.\nOnions contain organic sulfur compounds.\nOrganic sulfur compounds help reduce the level of cholesterol in your body and may also help break down blood clots, lowering your risk for heart disease and stroke.\nYou should eat onions raw rather than cooked to get the most sulfur compounds from them.\nBoth the quercetin and organic sulfur compounds found in onions are known to promote insulin production, making them a helpful vegetable choice for those with diabetes.\nWhen your body breaks down the sulfur compounds found in onions, they can react to sweat on your skin, creating what is generally considered to be an unpleasant body odor.\nWhen you do cut an onion, leave the root end intact, as this part of the onion holds the most organic sulfuric compounds, which are what make you cry.\nHere are some ways to add more onions to your diet: The American Journal of Chemical

sulfur-containing compounds.\nThey have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer, lower blood sugar levels, and improved bone health.\nOnions vary in size, shape, and color, but the most common types are white, yellow, and red.\nThe main nutrients in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw onions are (1Trusted Source): Carbohydrates make up about 9\u201310% of both raw and cooked onions.\nOnions are a decent source of fiber, which accounts for 0.9\u20132.6% of the fresh weight, depending on the type of onion.\nThis leads to the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which may improve colon health, reduce inflammation, and cut your risk of colon cancer (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nHowever, fructans are considered FODMAPs, which may cause unpleasant digestive symptoms in sensitive individuals, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\nTheir main fibers, fructans, can feed the friendly bacteria in your gut, though they may cause digestive problems in some people.\nThe health benefits of onions are attributed to their antioxidants and sulfur-containing compounds (3).\nIn fact, yellow onions may contain almost 11 times more antioxidants than white onions (25Trusted Source).\nCooking can significantly reduce levels of some antioxidants (26Trusted Source).\nType 2 diabetes is a common disease, characterized primarily by high blood sugar levels.\nAnimal studies suggest that onions can lower blood sugar levels (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nOne study in people with type 2 diabetes found that eating 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw onions per day led to a significant reduction in blood sugar levels (34Trusted Source).\nA large observational study in women over 50 years of age found that regular onion consumption is linked to increased bone density (42Trusted Source).\nFurther research indicates that intake of selected fruit, herbs, and vegetables, including onions, may reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women (43Trusted Source).\nObservational studies have linked increased consumption of onions to a reduced risk of several types of cancers, such as those of the stomach, breast, colon, and prostate (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source).\nThey may lower blood sugar levels, improve bone health, and reduce the risk of several types of cancers.\nSymptoms of onion intolerance include digestive disruption, such as upset stomach, heartburn, and gas (50Trusted Source).\nOnions contain FODMAPs, which are a category of carbs and fibers that many people cannot tolerate (9Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source).\nThey may cause unpleasant digestive symptoms, such as bloating, gas, cramping, and diarrhea (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nWhen cut, an onion\u2019s cells to release a gas called lachrymatory factor (LF) (54Trusted Source).\nThis illness is characterized by damage within animals\u2019 red blood cells, which leads to anemia (57Trusted Source).\nOnions may cause adverse digestive effects in some people, and raw onion can cause eye and mouth irritation.\nThey\u2019re high in antioxidants and sulfur-containing compounds, some of which may have a number of beneficial effects.\nAlthough more research is needed, onions have been linked to improved bone health, lower blood sugar levels, and a reduced risk of cancer.\nOn the other hand, they may cause digestive problems in some people."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/onion-benefits","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-onions","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/onions"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
