Florida - ScienceDirect"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"Little attention has been paid to the environmental impacts of clam cultivation, and although analogies can be made to other cultured species that have been more extensively researched, it should be noted that there are likely to be differences and that such analogies can only suggest possible impacts, and the actual effects should become the focus of future research.\nThe anticipated environmental impacts caused by the cultivation of clams can be separated into three main areas; There is little research into the effect of removing spat from the natural populations to suppor t clam cultivation, although evidence from mussel studies suggest that if too much of the natural spatfall is removed natural populations fail, causing increased mortality in organisms which predate in them.\nThe removal of clam seed by hydraulic dredges could potentially damage the benthic ecosystem and the communities residing there, although it should be noted that there has as yet been no research into such activities.\nIn the UK the majority of clam\u00a0 seed is produced by hatcheries and thus removes the problems associated with wild spat collection.\nThe authors concluded that, although the significant change in sediment ch aracteristics could potentially alter the ecosystem dynamics, such alterations were not evident and that there were no negative impacts on the environment from the culture site.\nThe action of the hydraulic dredge has a significant impact on the physical appearance of the sediment and on the benthos.\nSuch dramatic changes to the sediment or the benthos are unlikely to be covered by the criteria of P rinciple 2, therefore harvesting by hydraulic dredge could result in a fail ure to comply with Principle 2.\nNetting can be placed above the clams to reduce mortality from predation, but such activities can potentially\u00a0 affect sedimentation and local hydrography.\nA study by Munroe and McKinley (2007)\u00a0 demonstrated that although the netting appeared to increase the population of clams there were no significant effects on sediment\u00a0 composition.\nThey\u00a0 concluded that the netting had little effect on the environment and that\u00a0 increases in sedimentation noted in other studies are likely to be due to the individual oceanographic characteristics of each site.\nAs the netting is not having an effect on the ecosystem or the benthos the use of netting could comply with the criteria for\u00a0 Principle 2.","1":"In turn, shellfish farming can provide local communities with a variety of ecosystem services, whose value can be quantified.\nThree environmentally-beneficial ecosystem services (water filtration, nitrogen removal and carbon storage) provided by clam farming were examined.\nRead further for a description of these ecosystem services, their value estimates, and how they relate to Florida\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d clam culture industry.\nA single littleneck-sized clam can remove 0.09 grams of nitrogen from the water.\nA single littleneck-sized clam can store 2.76 grams of atmospheric carbon.\nThe contribution of the Florida hard clam industry to the mitigation of nitrogen and carbon extraction was assessed by UF economists.\nFor nitrogen removal, replacement cost values were based on the costs of wastewater treatment plants in various Florida cities.\nCosts included pine production, as well as the value of the land in an alternative use.\nHighlights of the UF study on environmentally-beneficial ecosystem services and their value provided by Florida hard clam production (statistics obtained from the 2012 Florida Aquaculture Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture) include: These results demonstrate the important contribution of hard clam culture to coastal ecosystem services.\nFindings on clam farm sustainability can benefit growers, wholesalers, and retailers by allowing them to inform buyers and consumers that shellfish aquaculture is a \u201cgreen\u201d industry and, in fact, provides ecosystem services.\nThe entire project report, \u201cGreen\u201d Clams: Estimating the Value of Environmental Benefits (Ecosystem Services) Generated by the Hard Clam Aquaculture Industry in Florida, can be viewed here.\nAs part of this project, a review of journal articles and posters, working papers, and dissertations pertaining to methods used to value ecosystem services provided by shellfish was conducted.\nThe Clam Farm Benefit Calculator allows Florida growers to make a simple estimation of the environmental benefits their farms provide on an annual basis to the coastal waters in which their crops are grown.\nFunding for this project was obtained from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services through the 2014-15 Florida Aquaculture Program (contract #00094300).","2":"Selected biological, chemical and physical factors were compared between a hard clam

Nutrition Facts"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"This popular shellfish offers exceptional nutrient density, and they are full of beneficial vitamins and minerals.\nClams are one of the most nutritious foods in the world, and they offer an exceptional range of nutrients.\nClams are one of the best dietary sources of vitamin B12, and they offer an impressive 824% of the reference daily intake (RDI) per 100 grams.\nOily fish such as mackerel, salmon, and sardines are the best dietary sources of omega-3.\nA 6-oz (170-gram) serving of clams provides 337 mg of omega-3, about two-thirds of which is DHA and EPA.\nMaintaining good tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids is important for our health, and research suggests that a higher intake may help to lower inflammation levels (7, 8, 9).\nPer 6 oz (170-gram) serving, clams supply 23.8 mg of iron, which works out to be 132% of the RDI.\nUnfortunately, iron-deficiency anemia is an increasing problem in both the developed and undeveloped world.\nWhile many people think that vitamin C only comes from fruit, there are a wide variety of foods that provide it.\nHowever, some animal foods\u2014particularly certain organ meats and shellfish\u2014can also be a good source of vitamin C.\nA regular 6-oz serving of oysters offers 22.2 mg of vitamin C, which is equal to 36% of the RDI.\nClams are an excellent lean source of protein, and they provide 12.8 grams per 100 g.\nClams are an outstanding protein source for anyone trying to either restrict calorie intake or get more protein-dense foods into the diet.\nCholine is not a vitamin, but it is a vitamin-like compound (and an essential nutrient) that plays an important role in health.\nFor one thing, an adequate intake of choline is important for liver health and appears to be protective against fatty liver disease (13, 14).\nYou may have heard eggs mentioned as the best source of choline; one large egg provides 147 mg (16).\nHowever, clams are also an excellent source, and a 6-oz serving offers 110 mg of choline (17).\nLastly, clams contain good amounts of a wide variety of vitamins and minerals.\nA 6-oz serving of clams offers nearly 60% of the RDI for selenium, and cooked clams provide 66 mcg of iodine per 100 grams (20).\nDespite this, clams are the fourth most common cause of a shellfish allergic reaction after shrimp, crab, and lobster (22).\nShellfish such as clams are one of the most common causes of food poisoning.\nThey can potentially cause the following conditions (23); Food poisoning largely comes from clams infected by marine toxins made by organisms called dinoflagellates, which are similar to algae.\nThis nutritious shellfish is incredibly protein-dense, and alongside liver, it is the most significant dietary source of vitamin B12.\nOverall, alongside oysters and organ meats, no other animal foods compare to the nutrient profile of clams.","1":"Persons that consume the highest levels of vitamin B12 are also less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease, making it a great idea to ensure that we top up our intake of this important vitamin.\nA 3 ounce serving of clams supplies approximately 24 mg of iron, whereas the daily recommended intake for adult stands at about 8 mg.\nWhile we know you won\u2019t be consuming clams every day, once a week or even per month is a great way to support your iron intake from other sources.\nIron helps to ensure that hemoglobin production is maintained, hemoglobin being the molecule that binds oxygen and carries it throughout the body.\nAs one may come to expect, clams are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, similar to their aquatic buddies the fishes.\nAgain, a 3 ounce serving of clams supplies approximately 140 mg of the omega-3 fatty acids, whereas daily intake of between 250 to 500 mg is recommended.\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of fatty fish, or can\u2019t stand the taste of the capsules, consumption of clams can help you come closer to your daily recommended intake.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are important for helping to support blood vessel flexibility, and reducing the likelihood of atherosclerotic plaques depositing on the inside of blood vessel walls, where they may occlude blood flow and increase your risk of strokes or heart attacks.\nSelenium lends itself to the production of many antioxidant enzymes in the body, which may just help to offset the inflammatory damage immune cells can cause to the joints.\nClams, like many other aquatic species, trap some of this mineral in the body, and condense it to become amongst the richest sources you can get via consumption.\nZinc is critically involved in a number of biochemical processes our body undergoes every single day, including detoxification, phagocytosis, and helping the immune system to produce white blood cells.\nOne of the easiest ways to go about helping support the production of collagen is to ensure your vitamin C requirements are met.\nVitamin C also improves the uptake of iron, which clams are already a great source of, and supports the immune system as well.\nTwo extremely important minerals for the production of sperm and seminal fluid in men are zinc and selenium, which are both abundantly found in clams.","2":"Could Not Retrieve
