Agency has identified three biogeographic regions in Turkey, the Black Sea, Mediterranean and Anatolian regions, which should be protected under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, to which Turkey is signatory.[5] Turkey had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.39\/10, ranking it 75th globally out of 172 countries.[6] Air pollution is particularly significant in urban areas;[7] the problem is especially acute in Istanbul,[8] Ankara, Erzurum, and Bursa, where the combustion of heating fuels increases particulate density in winter.\nAlmost all the urban population is exposed to particulate matter emissions higher than the EU and World Health Organization limits.[9] Especially in Istanbul, increased car ownership causes frequent urban smog conditions.[10] \"Air pollution in urban centers, often caused by transport, and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems.\"  \"PM10 levels are 36.7 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the OECD average of 20.9 micrograms per cubic meter, and the annual guideline limit of 20 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.\" Although there is some monitoring of air pollution compared with other European countries, many air pollution indicators are not available.[11] Regulations in Turkey do not contain any restrictions on the pollutant PM 2.5, which causes lung diseases.[12] Greenpeace Mediterranean claim that the Af\u015fin-Elbistan coal-fired plant is the power plant with the highest health risk in Europe, followed by the Soma coal-fired power plant, also in Turkey.[13][14] As of 2016[update] many municipalities use substandard dumps to dispose of waste.[15] Environmental noise data is not reported.[16] Summer temperatures have increased and are expected to continue to increase due to climate change.[17] Coal in Turkey emits a third of the country's greenhouse gas.","1":"Air pollution is a significant problem across Turkey, particularly in the country\u2019s urban centers.\nFurthermore, data acquired from Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Urbanization in 2017 found that the air pollution values in almost every province of this nation were between 151 and 200.\nTherefore, the organisms and plants inhabiting these areas are extremely vulnerable to the effects of \u00a0both climate change and the country's limited water resources.\nA major Turkish policy that includes elements of environmental protection is the country\u2019s Tenth Development Plan (2014-2018).\nAt the core of the plan are sustainable development and increasing development of Turkey\u2019s renewable energy sector, particularly for wind and geothermal power.\nWhile Turkey exhibits a promising future in the use and development of renewable energy sources, this nation has put a large emphasis on utilizing domestic coal to support their internal economic expansion and reduce the need to import oil and gas.\nCurrently, Turkey generates 28% of its electricity from coal; however, environmentalists predict that Turkey\u2019s wind, solar and hydropower energy sources have the potential to meet the nation\u2019s energy needs for the same cost of its planned coal expansion while simultaneously reducing the risk of increased emissions and air pollution that is commonly associated with coal use.\nIn April 2017, Turkey\u2019s Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak claimed that the nation aims to promote the production and use of clean coal within its nation\u2019s local coal industries.\nTurkey - Meeting Growing Energy Needs with Renewable Energy.\nIn an effort to advance its accession process into the European Union, Turkey has made efforts towards establishing emission controls, increase its use of renewable energies, and promote the overall energy efficiency of this nation.\nIn terms of regulating air quality and industrial pollution, Turkey has made considerable progress; however, further effort into fully implementing this legislation must still occur.\nIn an effort to improve the threats on Turkey\u2019s biodiversity, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Global Environment Facility have been working with the Turkish government to improve their conservation and sustainable management plans.\nOver the past decade, various factors within the international energy markets have compelled Turkey to reexamine how it generates and consumes electricity.\nThe result of this global analysis was the creation of a national development plan that supports investment in the country\u2019s renewable energy sector.\nIn 2016, two major projects described by the Renewable Energy Resource Area regulations have aimed to increase Turkey\u2019s wind energy production by 17%.\nBy 2023, Turkey aims to generate 30% of its total electricity from renewable energy sources.\nTurkey's push to embrace renewable energy has been backed by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), a billion-dollar program designed to give middle-income countries the resources to innovate and develop clean technology.\nData shows that Turkey has sufficient access to wind, water, and sunlight in order to research the potential of renewable energy.\nWith an exception to hydropower, Turkey\u2019s renewable electricity production currently accounts for 8% of the country\u2019s overall energy production.\nFurthermore, Turkey's Electricity Market and Security of Supply Strategy sets up an overall target of renewable energy supplying a minimum of 30 percent of overall energy produced by 2023.\nOf this renewable energy mix, wind power is projected to climb up to 20 GW.\nRetrieved on May 09, 2021 from

Reports are published every four years.\nEnvironmental Indicator Reports [2] [3] and Provincial State of the Environment Reports [4][5] are published annually.\nThese two documents are the main sources of the National State of the Environment Reports.\nThese pressures translate into a range of environmental challenges such as climate change, desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, nature degradation and marine pollution.\nTo address these challenges, Turkey has adopted new legislation and institutional practices as part of an effort to comply with the EU environmental acquis.\nHowever, additional legislative and institutional efforts need to be made in the fields of nature protection, chemicals, climate change and water management.\nTurkey's convergence with the EU environmental acquis requires comprehensive and costly investment, both in human and institutional capacity development as well as in infrastructure for activities such as environmental monitoring, inspection and reporting.\n[7] Turkey confronts the challenge of ensuring the integration of environmental protection and social inclusion into its plans for economic growth.\nTurkey is a party to all key international environmental conventions, which provide appropriate policy frameworks and promote cooperation and coherent action at global, regional and national levels to address environmental problems.\nTurkey is a party to all key international environmental conventions, which provide appropriate policy frameworks and promote cooperation and coherent action at global, regional and national levels to address environmental problems.\nRegional Sea Conventions for the Black Sea and Mediterranean are major policy instruments for Turkey to protect the marine and coastal environments of these valuable ecosystems.\nTurkey has developed and implemented a number of strategy documents for sectors such as mitigation and adaptation to climate change, conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, erosion control and combating desertification, reforestation, and afforestation.\nTurkey has a unique and exceptionally rich biodiversity.[9] Turkey consists of different micro-climatic zones and biogeographic regions, each with its own natural ecosystems.\nThere are five micro-gene centres in Turkey, which offer very important genetic resources for the future sustainability of many plant species cultivated across the world.\nTurkey has further improved protection of these areas via management plans.\nFurthermore, forest\u00a0areas of Turkey have increased as well, thanks to comprehensive afforestation\u00a0campaigns, which also contribute to efforts to\u00a0combat desertification.\nTurkey's rich biodiversity is highly vulnerable to climate change, which is also putting pressure on its limited water resources.\nAccording to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC\u00a0[11], future climate change could critically undermine efforts for sustainable development throughout the world and especially in the Mediterranean Basin.\nThey are part of the EEA's report SOER 2015, addressing the state of, trends in and prospects for the environment in
