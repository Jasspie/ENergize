But legal mechanisms alone won't be enough to ensure that all native mussel species can recover.\nTo help prevent the spread of invasive mussel species, everyone can \u2013 and needs to \u2013 play a role.","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.montgomerycountymd.gov\/water\/streams\/mussels.html","1":"defenders.org\/blog\/2021\/04\/massive-impact-of-mussels","2":"www.borgholm.se\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/BBG_Factsheet_Environmental_impacts.pdf"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 10","1":" 10","2":" 0"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"Mussels: Are They Good for You?

popular seafood varieties, and they offer exceptional nutritional value.\nIn this article, we take a more in-depth look at the nutrition profile and potential benefits of mussels.\nThe following data shows the nutritional values of mussels per 3.5 oz (100-gram) cooked serving (1).\nAs the table demonstrates, mussels are a good source of protein, and they contain low-to-moderate amounts of carbohydrates and fat.\nAdditionally, mussels provide a rare animal-based source of vitamin C, an essential vitamin with antioxidant functions (4).\nIn addition to their impressive vitamin content, mussels are also a substantial source of minerals.\nAmong these minerals, mussels provide large amounts of manganese, selenium, iron, zinc, and phosphorus.\nMussels offer almost one gram of omega-3 per 100 gram serving, making them a moderately-high source (1).\nDHA and EPA are both associated with numerous health benefits, and they reliably increase blood levels of omega-3 (6).\nShellfish allergy refers to an abnormal response to specific proteins found within mollusks and crustacean species.\nHowever, allergies to mollusks such as mussels are not uncommon (17).\nWhile relatively rare, foodborne illnesses are another potential concern with any species of shellfish, including mussels.\nMussels offer exceptional nutritional value, and their best benefit is the broad range of different nutrients they provide.\nFor example, mussels combine protein with a nutrient-rich package of omega-3 and significant amounts of vitamins and minerals.\nWhile there are some potential concerns to be aware of, it is fair to see that the benefits of mussels outweigh the drawbacks.","2":"Want to know more about this wonder food and the vast range of health benefits of mussels?\nserving of cooked
