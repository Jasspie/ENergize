Cranberry growing and how it is used are perhaps the biggest issues when it comes to environmental impact concerns.\nMassive amounts of water are needed throughout the growing season, both in the fall during harvest time and the spring and summer for irrigation.\nIf the cranberry growers are using agricultural methods that involve fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides, these runoffs of water can also be tainted with the harmful chemicals and distribute them far and wide.\nIn Wisconsin, growers\u2019 rights are still protected by the archaic Cranberry Law from 1867 which \u201cexempts [them] from being required to obtain permits before physically altering lakes and streams by setting up irrigation systems, ditches and dams.\u201d In Washington State, 70% of cranberries are drying harvested and 30% are wet harvested.\nThe chemicals were drifting into the ditch from the cranberry bogs when applied by the irrigation sprinklers.\nOne of the greatest hurdles to making cranberry growing less conventionally intensive with harmful chemicals like pesticides and insecticides is the lack of opportunity for organic growers to sell their product.\n4)

necessitated by the cranberry-growing conditions.\nMoist, wet cranberry bogs offer an ideal growing condition to incubate all sorts of unwanted flora and fauna, like invasive weeds and various bugs, including the cranberry weevil.\nThe cranberries are grown in bogs that are part of \u00a0national and international waterway systems.\nThe pesticides that are applied to the cranberries fill up the bog.\nAfter the cranberries are harvested, this mix of water and chemicals is then flushed onto the nearby land and connected waterways, becoming part of the effluvial pollutant flow.\nAgricultural runoff from the cranberry farming is now affecting the waterways of states with high cranberry production, including New England states, as well as Wisconsin.","2":"Unfortunately, conventionally-grown cranberries have a very large \u201cfoodprint\u201d because they are grown with lots of pesticides and fertilizers, which have negative impacts on the neighboring ecosystems, from soil and water to insects and wildlife.\nThis year there\u2019s a new issue to worry about: cranberry farmers are destroying a fourth of their crop since what they\u2019re growing has outpaced the market for them.\nCranberries need a lot of fresh water\u00a0and have a growing season that stretches from April to November.\nWhile there are some dry harvest\u00a0cranberry operations, 95 percent\u00a0of production happens in flood-harvest bogs.\nOn average, one acre of cranberries will use seven to ten feet\u00a0of water to meet all production, harvesting and flooding needs.\nThe dark side of this water conservation strategy is that, because pesticide and fertilizer use is heavy in cranberry bogs, the recycled water is full of lots of undesirable compounds that are eventually dumped into local waterways.\nCranberry cultivation degrades wetlands and, according to Macalester College, \u201c[c]ommercialized cranberry farming comes at a high price for the ecosystem surrounding the bog.\u201d Heavy pesticide use has consistently landed cranberries on lists\u00a0of fresh produce to either avoid or buy organic.\nIn addition to heavy pesticide use, fertilizers\u00a0are also applied and, as is the case with most terrestrial agriculture, algal blooms\u00a0from runoff are a common problem for waterways downstream from cranberry bogs.\nIt was also during the 90s that the US Army Corps of Engineers started regulating growers by classifying cranberry bogs\u00a0as wetlands, which require permits for certain activities.\nMost regulation of cranberry production runoff happens at the state level and varies state-to-state, or occurs through voluntary adherence to BMPs on the part of growers.\nLook for fresh (and therefore dry-harvested) cranberries at the farmers\u2019 market and even in grocery stores (you can freeze them for later use).\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, and with a little searching and some specific requests, you might be able to get your market to order some of these organic cranberry products for

urinary tract infections (UTIs).\nThis article tells you everything you need to know about cranberries, including their nutrition facts and health benefits.\nCranberries are primarily composed of carbs and fiber (1Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, cranberry juice contains virtually no fiber and is usually diluted with other fruit juices \u2014 and sweetened with added sugar (3Trusted Source).\nCranberries are very high in bioactive plant compounds and antioxidants \u2014 particularly flavonol polyphenols (2Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nMany of these plant compounds are concentrated in the skin \u2014 and are greatly reduced in cranberry juice (3Trusted Source).\nSome of these, such as A-type proanthocyanidins, may help prevent UTIs. To help you be well, we\u2019ll send you honest talk about women\u2019s bodies, and beauty, nutrition, and fitness advice.\nUTIs are among the most common bacterial infections \u2014 especially among women (15Trusted Source).\ncoli from attaching to the lining of your bladder and urinary tract, making cranberries a potential preventive measure against UTIs (13, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nIn fact, cranberries are among the richest fruit sources of proanthocyanidins \u2014 especially the A-type (14Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nA number of human studies indicate that drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry supplements may reduce the risk of UTIs in both children and adults (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nNot all cranberry products are effective against UTIs. In fact, proanthocyanidins may be lost during processing, making them undetectable in many products (35Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, cranberry supplements \u2014 which contain sufficient amounts of A-type proanthocyanidins \u2014 may be a useful preventive strategy.\nCranberry juice and supplements may reduce your risk of UTIs. However, they do not treat this infection.\nStomach cancer is a common cause of cancer-related death worldwide (36Trusted Source).\nCranberries contain unique plant compounds known as A-type proanthocyanidins, which may cut your risk of stomach cancer by preventing H.\npylori in about 17% of those infected (41Trusted Source).\npylori in about 17% of those infected (41Trusted Source).\nIn human studies, cranberry juice or extracts have proven beneficial for various heart disease risk factors.\nIf consumed regularly, cranberries or cranberry juice may reduce your risk of stomach cancer.\nThe juice and extract also improve several risk factors for heart disease, including cholesterol levels and blood pressure.\nHowever, excessive consumption may cause stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 and may also increase the risk of kidney stones in predisposed individuals.\nMost kidney stones are made of calcium oxalate, so excessive amounts of oxalate in your urine is one of the main risk factors (56Trusted Source).\nFor this reason, they are considered a risk factor for kidney stones when consumed in high amounts (57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).\nHigh consumption of cranberries may increase the risk of kidney stones in predisposed individuals.\nSome of these compounds may help prevent UTIs, stomach cancer, and heart disease.","1":"You may associate cranberries with the holidays, but there are good reasons to consume them year-round, either frozen, dried, or in juice form.\nHere are six cranberry benefits, including new research about how these

incredible berries are loaded with health-promoting antioxidants, which help protect cells against free radical damage and aid in the prevention of chronic disease.\n(1) Cranberries should be a staple on every shopping list for many reasons, including their ability to reduce body-wide inflammation, boost immunity and more.\nOne of the most well-known cranberry benefits is its ability to act as a home remedy for urinary tract infections\u00a0(UTIs).\nCranberry fruit is thought to contain specific compounds that prevent bacteria from attaching to the inner surface of the urinary tract or bladder.\n(4) For this reason, many health professionals recommend drinking one to two glasses of 100 percent pure, unsweetened or lightly sweetened cranberry juice a day to aid in the prevention of urinary tract infections.\nStudies offer evidence that women who drink cranberry juice frequently may suffer fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections.\n(5, 6) Cranberry juice, capsules and tablets are good alternatives to antibiotics, which come with a slew of adverse side effects like yeast infections, digestive issues and\u00a0antibiotic resistance.\nWhen reviewers compared cranberry juice, capsules or tablets with a placebo or water for the prevention of UTIs in a variety of populations, results showed that over a 12-month period, cranberry products reduced the overall incidence of UTIs by 35 percent.\nFortunately, anti-inflammatory foods\u00a0like cranberries can help naturally combat inflammation thanks to their rich content of antioxidants.\nAll berries help fight free radicals thanks to their antioxidant content, but cranberries are one of the top sources.\nA diet low in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory foods results in an abundance of\u00a0free radicals\u00a0within the body.\nLoading up on antioxidant-rich foods like cranberries is an easy way to fight the effects of free radicals and relieve inflammation.\nResearch shows that cranberries contain cancer-fighting substances that may be helpful in preventing the growth of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer cells.\nIn fact, both human and animal studies show that cranberries may help slow tumor progression and block the growth of cancer cells.\n(8,\u00a09) Coupled with their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cranberries may help lower the risk of some of the most common types of cancers.\nThe high levels of proanthocyanidins that are found in cranberries help the body\u2019s immune function ward off illness and disease.\n(10) One of the biggest benefits of cranberry juice is its ability to ward off harmful bacteria and keep it from accumulating and growing in the gut lining.\nThis allows healthy,\u00a0immune-boosting\u00a0bacteria to thrive and create a powerful defense against illness and infection.\nIn fact, studies show that it could reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of conditions like pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea.\nRecent research shows that cranberry benefits help optimize the balance of bacteria in the entire digestive tract.\nCranberries act similarly to how\u00a0probiotics\u00a0found in kombucha, kefir or yogurt do to create an environment of healthy \u201cgut flora.\u201d (12) Digestive health benefits from cranberries are undeniable because of the fruit\u2019s ability to balance bacteria in the body.\nThis not only relieves symptoms like constipation,\u00a0diarrhea\u00a0and stomach acid, but also helps boost immunity and nutrient absorption by fostering the health of the gut microbiome.\n(13) Studies show that adding cranberries to your diet could come with a number of benefits to heart health due to their ability to block blood clotting, reduce blood pressure and decrease inflammation.\n(14) In one study, consuming low-calorie cranberry juice was found to reduce several risk factors of heart disease, including blood pressure, triglyceride levels, inflammation and insulin resistance.\n(15) Other research shows that cranberries and cranberry juice could also help lower levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, increase beneficial HDL cholesterol and prevent a stiffening of the arteries in people with heart disease.\nMany of these phytonutrients offer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer health benefits.\nOne cup (about 110 grams) of chopped, raw cranberries contains approximately: (19) Along with an impressive amount of vitamins and minerals, cranberries also boast high levels of phytonutrients.\nSome of the most powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants in cranberries include: Cranberries have long been used in traditional medicine and are believed to treat a wide variety of conditions and ailments.\nHistorically, Native Americans used cranberries to manage bleeding, promote digestive health and treat conditions like urinary tract infections.\nAdditionally, while raspberries and blueberries are often enjoyed fresh as is, cranberries are typically dried or used in baked goods to
