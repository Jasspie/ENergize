forbidden in certain religions, such as Islam and Judaism.\nBeing high in protein and rich in many vitamins and minerals, lean pork can be an excellent addition to a healthy diet.\nPork is a high-protein food and contains varying amounts of fat.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of cooked, ground pork provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Like all meat, pork is mostly made up of protein.\nFor this reason, eating pork \u2014 or other types of meat \u2014 may be particularly beneficial for bodybuilders, recovering athletes, people post-surgery, or others who need to build up or repair muscles.\nLike other types of red meat, pork is mainly composed of saturated fats and unsaturated fats \u2014 present in approximately equal amounts.\nFor example, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of cooked, ground pork packs about 7.7 grams of saturated, 9.3 grams of monounsaturated, and 1.9 grams of polyunsaturated fat (1Trusted Source).\nHigh-quality protein is the main nutritional component of pork, making it useful for muscle growth and maintenance.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Pork is high in various healthy vitamins and minerals, as well as high-quality protein.\nLike most animal foods, pork is an excellent source of high-quality protein.\nInadequate intake of high-quality protein may accelerate age-related muscle degeneration \u2014 increasing your risk of sarcopenia (14Trusted Source).\nEating pork \u2014 or other protein-rich foods \u2014 is an excellent way to ensure sufficient dietary intake of high-quality protein that may help preserve muscle mass.\nAside from being rich in high-quality protein, pork contains a variety of healthy nutrients that are beneficial for your muscles.\nIn fact, high levels of carnosine in human muscles have been linked to reduced fatigue and improved physical performance (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nFollowing vegetarian or vegan diets \u2014 which are low in beta-alanine \u2014 reduces the amount of carnosine in muscles over time (21Trusted Source).\nIn contrast, high dietary intake of beta-alanine \u2014 including from supplements \u2014 increases muscle carnosine levels (15Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nAs a result, eating pork \u2014 or other rich sources of beta-alanine \u2014 may be beneficial for those who want to maximize their physical performance.\nPork is an excellent source of high-quality protein, so it should be effective for the growth and maintenance of muscle mass.\nLike other types of meat, it may also help improve muscle function and exercise performance.\nIt\u2019s clear that a high meat intake is linked to unhealthy lifestyle factors, such as low consumption of fruit and vegetables, less physical activity, smoking, and overeating (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nOne popular hypothesis links the cholesterol and saturated fat content of meat to an increased risk of heart disease.\nHowever, dietary cholesterol has little or no effect on cholesterol levels in most people and many scientists don\u2019t consider it a health concern (13Trusted Source).\nModerate consumption of lean pork \u2014 as a part of a healthy diet \u2014 is unlikely to increase your risk of heart disease.\nMany observational studies note a link between red meat and colon cancer risk \u2014 although the evidence is not entirely consistent (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nStill, the idea that a high intake of meat causes cancer is plausible.\nOvercooked meat may contain a number of carcinogenic substances \u2014 most notably heterocyclic amines (39Trusted Source).\nHeterocyclic amines are a family of unhealthy substances found in relatively high amounts in well-done and overcooked meat, fish, or other sources of animal protein.\nStudies suggest that foods high in heterocyclic amines raise the risk of several types of cancer, such as of the colon, breast, and prostate (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source).\nIn the context of a healthy diet, moderate intake of adequately cooked pork probably does not increase your risk of cancer.\nHowever, high consumption of overcooked pork is a cause for concern.\nEating raw or undercooked (rare) pork should be avoided \u2014 especially in developing countries.\nThat\u2019s because raw pork may contain several types of parasites that can infect humans (47Trusted Source).\nHowever, it may occasionally lead to a disease known as cysticercosis, estimated to affect approximately 50 million people each year (47Trusted Source).\nThough this condition is uncommon in developed countries, eating raw or undercooked (rare) pork may increase your risk \u2014 especially when the meat is from free-ranging, wild, or backyard pigs (47Trusted Source).\nIn developed countries, such as the United States, the most common cause of infection is the consumption of raw or undercooked pork (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s a rich source of high-quality protein, as well as various vitamins and minerals.\nThough not exactly a health food, moderate consumption of properly prepared pork can be an acceptable part of a healthy diet.","1":"100 grams (3.5 ounces) of cooked ground pork contains: Pork is also a good source of vitamins and minerals like phosphorus, selenium, and thiamine.\nPork is actually richer in thiamine, a B vitamin required for a range of bodily functions, than other red meats like beef and lamb.\nPork is a rich source of certain vitamins and minerals your body needs to function, like iron and zinc.\nThe high-quality proteins in pork are complete amino acids and therefore perfect building blocks for creating new muscle.\nEating high quality protein like that found in pork \u2014 as part of a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise \u2014 can help slow or reverse sarcopenia.\nPork contains the amino acid beta-alanine, which helps your body form a compound called carnosine.\nWhile pork is rich in several important vitamins and nutrients, it can also be high in sodium and saturated fats, two things that should be avoided as part of a healthy diet.\nIf you\u2019re on a low sodium diet due to concerns over your heart health and\/or avoiding saturated fats, you should consume the leanest, least-processed varieties of pork you can find.\nCertain cured pork products like bacon contain sulfates or sulfites, chemical preservatives which you should consume in small quantities or avoid altogether.\nIt\u2019s best to avoid fat-heavy pork products like bacon.\nEating raw or undercooked pork can also result in trichinosis, an infection of parasitic roundworms called Trichinella.\nTo avoid parasitic infection, always cook pork thoroughly.","2":"Could
