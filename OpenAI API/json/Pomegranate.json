Source).\nThe seeds and arils are the edible parts of the fruit \u2014 eaten either raw or processed into pomegranate juice \u2014 but the peel is discarded.\nThey\u2019re so powerful that pomegranate juice has been found to have three times the antioxidant activity of red wine and green tea (3Trusted Source).\nTest-tube studies have shown that they can reduce inflammatory activity in the digestive tract, as well as in breast cancer and colon cancer cells (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nOne 12-week study in people with diabetes found that 1.1 cups (250 ml) of pomegranate juice per day lowered the inflammatory markers CRP and interleukin-6 by 32% and 30%, respectively (7Trusted Source).\nThe punicalagins in pomegranate juice have been shown to reduce inflammation, one of the leading drivers of many serious diseases, including cancer and diabetes.\nLaboratory studies suggest that pomegranate extract may slow cancer cell reproduction and even induce apoptosis, or cell death, in cancer cells (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, a human study found that drinking 8 ounces (237 ml) of pomegranate juice per day increased the PSA doubling time from 15 months to 54 months \u2014 a monumental increase (10Trusted Source).\nA follow-up study found similar improvements using a type of pomegranate extract called POMx (11Trusted Source).\nLaboratory studies suggest that pomegranate extract can help fight breast cancer cells, but human studies are needed.\nIn one study, people with hypertension had a significant reduction in blood pressure after consuming 5 ounces (150 ml) of pomegranate juice daily for two weeks (15Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, laboratory studies suggest that pomegranate extract can block enzymes that are known to damage joints in people with osteoarthritis (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nThis extract has also been shown to relieve arthritis in mice, but evidence from human-based research is very limited so far (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nStudies in animals and isolated cells indicate that pomegranate extract may be beneficial against several forms of arthritis, but human research is needed.\nHeart disease is currently the world\u2019s most common cause of premature death (22Trusted Source).\nA 4-week study in 51 people with high triglyceride levels showed that 800 mg of pomegranate seed oil per day significantly lowered triglycerides and improved the triglyceride-HDL ratio (23Trusted Source).\nAnother study looked at the effects of pomegranate juice in people with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\nPomegranate juice has also been shown \u2014 in both animal and human studies \u2014 to protect LDL cholesterol particles from oxidation, one of the key steps in the pathway towards heart disease (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nFinally, one research analysis concluded that pomegranate juice reduces high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease (29Trusted Source).\nSeveral human studies have shown that pomegranate can have benefits against heart disease.\nPomegranate juice has been shown to help increase blood flow and erectile response in rabbits (30Trusted Source).\nIn a study in 53 men with erectile dysfunction, pomegranate appeared to have some benefit \u2014 but it was not statistically significant (31Trusted Source).\nThe plant compounds in pomegranate can help fight harmful microorganisms (32Trusted Source).\nOne study in surgical patients found that 2 grams of pomegranate extract prevented deficits in memory after surgery (37Trusted Source).\nAnother study in 28 older adults with memory complaints found that 8 ounces (237 ml) of pomegranate juice per day significantly improved markers of verbal and visual memory (38Trusted Source).\nStudies in mice also suggest that pomegranate may help fight Alzheimer\u2019s disease (39Trusted Source).\nAs a rich source of nitrates, pomegranate may improve exercise performance by increasing blood flow.\nThey have wide-ranging benefits and may help reduce your risk of various serious illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.\nHere are 10 evidence-based health benefits of\u2026 This article reviews how many servings of fruit you should eat per day.","1":"Modern science has found that pomegranates can help protect your heart and may even prevent cancer.\nA pomegranate is a sweet, tart fruit with thick, red skin.\nBottled pomegranate juice is also an easy way to enjoy some of the health benefits of this delicious fruit.\nAntioxidants protect cells from damage, prevent diseases \u2014 such as cancer \u2014 and reduce inflammation and the effects of aging.\nStudies have suggested that pomegranates can protect the heart in many ways, including lowering blood pressure and reducing blood sugar levels.\nPomegranate juice may help reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2014 \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol\u201d \u2014 that clogs arteries.\nInitial studies have revealed that people with type 2 diabetes who began to drink pomegranate juice showed an improvement in insulin resistance.\nPomegranates can also help people without diabetes maintain a healthy weight.\nIn some studies, pomegranates show potential to be effective in preventing prostate, breast, lung, and colon cancers.\nAdditionally, preclinical studies on animals have shown that eating pomegranate can inhibit the growth of lung, skin, colon, and prostate tumors.\nNext, slice deep enough to cut through the skin and the white membrane without cutting the pomegranate seeds.\nPull the seeds away from the membrane and skin, allowing them to fall into the bowl of water.","2":"A pomegranate is a ruby-red fruit with juicy seeds\u2014called arils\u2014that can be added to salads, cocktails, and meat- or rice-based entrees.\nThis versatile fruit provides important vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and copper, along with a healthy dose of fiber.\nWhile it can be labor-intensive to free the arils from the flesh of the pomegranate, it's worth it for their bright flavor and antioxidants.\nThis\u00a0nutrition information, for one medium pomegranate (3-3\/8\" in diameter), is provided by the USDA.1\ufeff Pomegranate calories come primarily from carbohydrates.\nYou'll get 21 grams of sugar if you consume a\u00a0medium-sized fruit.\nAs expected, carb counts, sugars, and calories are different for\u00a0pomegranate juice compared to the fruit.\nOne cup (8 oz) of 100% pomegranate juice provides 134 calories, 33 grams of carbohydrate, 31 grams of sugar, and 0 grams of fiber, according to USDA data.2\ufeff Pomegranate juice cocktail (which is pomegranate juice blended with other fruit juices and added sugar) usually has more calories, carbs, and sugar than plain pomegranate juice.\nIt is considered to be more helpful than just using glycemic index for people who are choosing foods based on their effects on blood glucose.\nA medium-sized fruit provides 3 grams of protein.\nPomegranate juice, on the other hand, provides almost no protein (0.4 grams per cup).1\ufeff Whole, fresh pomegranate\u00a0contains important vitamins and minerals.\nThere is 16mg of vitamin C in a medium-sized fruit, which is about 18% recommended daily value based on a 2,000-calorie diet.\nA medium-sized pomegranate also contains 28% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin K for women and 21% for men.1\ufeff Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps with blood clotting functions in the body.\nPomegranates are also a good source of folate (15% of RDA), copper (27% of RDA), thiamin (9% of RDA), vitamin B6 (9% of RDA), and potassium (10% of the recommended intake; potassium does not have an RDA).\nIf you drink pomegranate juice, you'll still benefit from vitamin K, folate, and (some) copper, but the juice provides almost no vitamin C, according to the USDA.2\ufeff However, new products come out every day which may include vitamin C.\nPomegranate seeds and juice contain compounds and nutrients with health-promoting qualities.\nVitamin C must be consumed through the diet because our bodies are unable to make it.3\ufeff According to the National Institutes of Health, \"ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role.\"3\ufeff Pomegranates also contain other antioxidant compounds, such as quercetin and anthocyanins, which also work to repair cell damage caused by oxidative stress.4\ufeff You'll get a healthy boost of fiber\u00a0when you consume pomegranate arils (not juice).\nIf you are on medication, speak with your healthcare provider before including the fruit in your diet to stay safe.\nBecause pomegranate is rich in vitamin K, it may interfere with the blood clotting medicine Coumadin (warfarin).8\ufeff But appropriate dietary levels of vitamin K vary, so discuss your diet with your doctor if you take this medicine.\nA fresh ripe pomegranate should feel heavy when it is ready to eat.\nPomegranates that have started to turn brown are likely past their prime, but abrasions to the fruit do not affect its quality (and you don't eat the skin anyway, so there's no need to discard the fruit if it has marks).9\ufeff You can also purchase just the pomegranate arils (seeds) in the refrigerated or frozen section of some grocery stores, but they are often more expensive than purchasing the whole fruit.\nKeep your pomegranates intact (whole) until you are ready to eat the arils.\nHowever, the arils are only good for about three days once they are removed from the fruit.\nYou can often find containers of pomegranate arils, already removed from the fruit, for sale in the produce section; keep these in the refrigerator, too.\nPomegranate \"seeds\" are actually called arils.\nInside each aril is a white seed that you can either eat or spit out, although the seeds provide fiber.\nMost people prefer not to eat the skin or the white flesh that surrounds the arils.\nThere are several different ways to de-seed a pomegranate, but the simplest method is to simply cut the fruit into quarters and immerse the pieces in a large bowl of water.\nOnce you've got your pomegranate arils, sprinkle them in yogurt, on a salad, or into your sparkling water or eat them alone as a snack.\nAllergy to pomegranate and artichoke, novel food allergens of the Mediterranean
