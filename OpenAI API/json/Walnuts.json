I keep a bag of nuts and dried fruit in my desk at work.\nPeanuts are much cheaper than tree nuts, but the amount of saturated fat gives me pause.\nI don\u2019t know anything about the impacts of growing some of the more exotic nuts, like Brazil nuts, cashews, and hazelnuts.\nA.

And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation\u2019s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don\u2019t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou\u2019ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you\u2019re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to give you plenty of permutations for your trail mix, so I do hope you find some recipes to your liking.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate, justice, and solutions.\nYour support helps Grist reveal the under-reported connection between social justice and climate change.","1":"Try refining your search, or use the navigation above to locate the post.","2":"California walnut growers and processors support research and innovation in water quality and conservation; soil health; energy use; and air quality.\n.

preliminary, small study in healthy adults showed that eating a walnut-rich meal prevented oxidative damage of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol after eating, whereas a refined-fat meal didn\u2019t (3Trusted Source).\nWalnuts are an excellent source of antioxidants that can help fight oxidative damage in your body, including damage due to \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, which promotes atherosclerosis.\nWalnuts are significantly higher in omega-3 fat than any other nut, providing 2.5 grams per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving (6, 7Trusted Source).\nObservational studies have shown that each gram of ALA you eat per day lowers your risk of dying from heart disease by 10% (9Trusted Source).\nWalnuts are a good source of the plant form of omega-3 fat, which may help reduce heart disease risk.\nBeneficial bacteria in your gut convert ellagitannins to compounds called urolithins, which have been found to protect against inflammation (5Trusted Source).\nAn unhealthy composition of your microbiota can contribute to inflammation and disease in your gut and elsewhere in your body, increasing your risk of obesity, heart disease and cancer (12Trusted Source).\nWhen 194 healthy adults ate 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of walnuts every day for eight weeks, they had an increase in beneficial bacteria, compared to a period of not eating walnuts (13Trusted Source).\nThis included an increase in bacteria that produce butyrate, a fat that nourishes your gut and promotes gut health (14Trusted Source).\nThis promotes the health of your gut and may help reduce disease risk.\nTest-tube, animal and human observational studies suggest that eating walnuts may reduce your risk of certain cancers, including breast, prostate and colorectal cancers (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nMore human studies are needed to confirm the effects of eating walnuts on decreasing the risk of these and other cancers, as well as to clarify all the ways or mechanisms by which they may help.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Walnuts are calorie dense, but studies suggest that the energy absorbed from them is 21% lower than would be expected based on their nutrients (19Trusted Source).\nIn a well-controlled study in 10 obese people, drinking a smoothie made with about 1.75 ounces (48 grams) of walnuts once a day for five days decreased appetite and hunger, compared to a placebo drink equal in calories and nutrients (20Trusted Source).\nObservational studies suggest that one reason walnuts are linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes is that they help control weight.\nExcess weight increases your risk of high blood sugar and diabetes (21Trusted Source).\nIn a controlled study in 100 people with type 2 diabetes, consuming 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed walnut oil a day for 3 months, while continuing their usual diabetes medication and balanced diet, resulted in an 8% decrease in fasting blood sugar (22Trusted Source).\nEating walnuts may help control type 2 diabetes and reduce your risk of the disease, as the nut may help control your weight.\nSome studies suggest that eating walnuts may help lower blood pressure, including in people with high blood pressure and in healthy people when under stress.\nAmong other diets, the four-year PREDIMED study in about 7,500 adults at high risk of heart disease tested a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 1 ounce (28 grams) of mixed nuts daily, of which half were walnuts.\nAt the end of the study, people on the nut-enriched Mediterranean diet had a 0.65 mmHg greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) than people on a similar heart-healthy control diet who weren\u2019t given nuts (25Trusted Source).\nThis suggests that nuts may slightly improve the blood pressure benefits of a heart-healthy diet.\nThis is important, as small differences in blood pressure are thought to have a big impact on your risk of heart disease death (25Trusted Source).\nSome studies suggest that eating 1 ounce (28 grams) of nuts daily, including walnuts, as part of a heart-healthy diet may help improve blood pressure.\nThough high in calories, walnuts are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, fats and plant compounds that may help support good physical functioning as you age (27Trusted Source).\nAnimal and test-tube studies found that the nutrients in walnuts, including polyunsaturated fat, polyphenols and vitamin E, may help reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in your brain (28Trusted Source).\nIn a 10-month study of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mice fed 6\u20139% of their calories as walnuts (equal to 1\u20131.5 ounces or 28\u201345 grams daily in people) had significant improvements in learning skills, memory and anxiety reduction, compared to a walnut-free control group (29Trusted Source).\nObservational studies in older adults have linked eating walnuts to better brain function, including faster processing speed, more mental flexibility and better memory (28Trusted Source).\nTypical Western diets \u2014 high in processed foods, sugar and refined grains \u2014 have been linked to reduced sperm function (30Trusted Source).\nWhen 117 healthy young men included 2.5 ounces (75 grams) of walnuts daily in their Western-style diet for three months, they had improved sperm shape, vitality and mobility, compared to men not eating nuts (31Trusted Source).\nAnimal research suggests that eating walnuts may help protect sperm by reducing oxidative damage in their membranes (30Trusted Source).\nFor example, in a recent study in 194 healthy adults, eating 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of walnuts daily for eight weeks produced a 5% decrease in total cholesterol, 5% decrease in LDL cholesterol and 5% decrease in triglycerides, compared to not eating walnuts (33Trusted Source).\nWhen elevated, apolipoprotein-B is a major risk factor for heart disease (33Trusted Source).\nA daily 1.5-ounce (43-gram) serving of walnuts may help lower harmful cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which contribute to heart disease risk.\nThis rich nutrient profile contributes to the many health benefits associated with walnuts, such as reduced inflammation and improved heart disease risk factors.\nScientists are still uncovering the many ways that walnuts\u2019 fiber and plant compounds, including polyphenols, may interact with your gut microbiota and contribute to your health.\nNuts are packed full of beneficial nutrients that may reduce your risk of many diseases.","2":"A 2020 study, published in the journal Nutrients, assessed the effects of walnut consumption on the omega-3 fatty acid profile of healthy adults over a four-week period.\nResearchers found that after a month of consuming a few ounces of walnuts daily, the subjects' omega-3 status improved.\nIn a six-week Penn State study of overweight adults with cardiovascular risk, the addition of walnuts to their diet enhanced beneficial gut bacteria linked to health benefits, including reduced blood pressure and total cholesterol.\nIn a 2019 study, published in Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers found that when study subjects ate whole walnuts, they experienced greater benefits than when they consumed a diet with a similar fatty acid profile without walnuts.\nEating walnuts may help slow cognitive decline in at-risk groups of older adults, according to a 2020 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\nIn the trial, women with breast lumps were randomly assigned to consume either two ounces of walnuts per day or no walnuts for two to three weeks prior to surgery.\nIn a small trail published in the journal Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism, subjects were given smoothies that either contained walnuts or no walnuts for five days, while living in a controlled clinical research center.\nThe largest clinical trial to date to analyzing the effects of nut consumption on sexual function in healthy men was published in the journal Nutrients in 2019.\nResearchers found that over 14 weeks, men who ate about two servings (two ounces) of a nut mixture daily as part of a Western-style diet experienced a significant increase in orgasmic function and sexual desire."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"planters.com","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-walnuts","2":"www.health.com\/nutrition\/walnut-benefits"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":"
