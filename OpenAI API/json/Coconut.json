and coconut production is one of the best eco-friendly alternatives.\nSeveral studies have indicated the adverse effect of dairy sourcing from cows on global warming due to their substantial release of massive amounts of dangerous greenhouse gases, which include methane and nitrous oxide through their feces and burps.\nThis is because high-production dairy cows each need to eat up to 120 pounds of wet feed a day and up to 55 pounds of dry matter such as baled hay and grain mix.\nIn 2018, a study at the University of Oxford concluded that the best action we can take to stop the environmental footprint of livestock is to stop (or limit) our use of dairy products and consumption of meat.\nIf you are a regular consumer of milk and creamers, you can still get these products from coconuts.\nNot only are coconuts a perfect source of milk and creamer products, but every part of the coconut tree is useful in the sense that they are also used for the manufacture of other essential products that we need in our lives.\nThis is not to say that milk and creamer sourced from coconut production doesn't have environmental impact.","2":"It has gone from being an exotic tropical fruit, limited to desserts and the occasional pina colada, to an important pantry staple in its many forms \u2015 coconut oil, water, milk, cream, sugar, flour, flakes, chips and more.\nWhile environmentalists encourage people to eat locally, sustainably and with a minimal carbon footprint, there is nothing local \u2015 or usually even continental \u2015 about the consumption of coconut in the United States and Europe, the largest importers of coconut products.\nThe demand for coconuts in developed countries is putting a strain on their natural sustainable production by farmers in the developing world.\n\u201cWe end up creating a monocrop plantation that will wipe out all other crops,\u201d said Tomy Mathew, founder of Fair Trade Alliance Kerala and an Indian fair trade and organic certified company that exports coconut products to the U.S. and Europe.\nMathew noted that large plantations in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for example, are located in already water-starved regions whose water supplies are now being depleted \u201cat an alarming rate to irrigate these farms.\u201d \u201cAs it happened with cocoa, as with vanilla, that sort of resource-intensive production is not sustainable in the long run,\u201d Mathew said.\nFarmers working vanilla and cocoa plantations in the Indian state of Kerala saw tremendous loss of income when the prices for those commodities crashed.\nOften by the time the fruits are ready, the trend has already passed, forcing poorer farmers to farm chemically to get faster results.\u201d She pointed, as an example, to the environmental costs of chemically grown avocados in Mexico, planted to feed the avocado boom in the U.S. Coconut trees have a productive life of 30 to 40 years.\nWith many of their trees long past peak productivity, the coconut farming industry in Asia has been plagued with low yields for years.\n\u201cMost planters are shying away from coconut production as a result of exorbitant wages being demanded to climb coconut trees and de-husk nuts,\u201d said Mathew Jose, founder of the company Farm Origin.\nHe said market conditions in Kerala, the highest coconut-producing state in India, are one of the big reasons that production is on the decline.\n\u201cFarmers in that region are choosing instead to either commercialize their land or grow exotic fruit trees (rambutan, mangosteen) to increase revenue,\u201d he said.\nTomy Mathew explained that aggregators and middlemen in the coconut trade drive fluctuations in the market price of coconut, which eventually affects farmers\u2019 livelihoods.\nUnless it\u2019s a supply chain that promises a fair price to the primary producer, I would look at this product with a huge question mark,\u201d Mathew said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important to ask questions about sustainable supply chains,\u201d said Mathew, stressing the need for people to hold accountable the brands they patronize.\nIn particular, he suggested looking for brands that try to ensure fair prices for coconut farmers and encourage multi-crop farming."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.onegreenplanet.org\/environment\/is-your-obsession-with-coconuts-harming-the-environment\/","1":"coconutcloud.net\/blogs\/coconut-cloud\/the-environmental-impact-of-coconut-production","2":"www.huffpost.com\/entry\/obsession-coconut-products-bad-environment_l_5f7b4417c5b63a58a845b382"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 0","1":" 10","2":" 10"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"5 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Coconut","1":"Coconut: Is It Good for You?

but recently increased in popularity for their flavor, culinary uses, and potential health benefits (1).\nCoconut oil is also extracted from the meat (2, 3, 4Trusted Source).\nUnlike many other fruits that are high in carbs, coconuts provide mostly fat (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nCoconuts are especially high in manganese, which is essential for bone health and the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and cholesterol (8Trusted Source).\nStudies have found that people who live on Polynesian islands and frequently eat coconut meat have lower rates of heart disease than those who follow a Western diet (10Trusted Source).\nHowever, native Polynesians also eat more fish and less processed foods, so it\u2019s unclear if these lower rates are due to eating coconut or other aspects of their diet (10Trusted Source).\nAnother study in 1,837 Filipino women found that those who ate more coconut oil not only had higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol but also higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides (10Trusted Source).\nOverall, it concluded that coconut oil has a neutral effect on cholesterol levels (10Trusted Source).\nA study in 20 people with obesity found the waist size of male participants decreased by an average of about 1 inch (about 3 cm) after they consumed 1 ounce (30 ml) of virgin coconut oil daily for 4 weeks.\nHowever, in one longer study, women who consumed 1 ounce (30 ml) of refined coconut oil daily for 12 weeks experienced a reduction of 0.5 inches (1.4 cm) from their waist measurement, on average (17Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Coconut is low in carbs and high in fiber and fat, so it may help stabilize your blood sugar.\nArginine is an amino acid that\u2019s important for the functioning of pancreatic cells, which release the hormone insulin to regulate your blood sugar levels (18Trusted Source).\nWhen rats with diabetes were fed protein made from coconut meat, their blood sugar, insulin levels, and other glucose metabolism markers were much better than those that didn\u2019t eat coconut protein (18Trusted Source).\nResearchers suspected the improved beta-cell function was also due to the high amounts of arginine found in coconut (18Trusted Source).\nThe high fiber content of coconut meat can also help slow digestion and improve insulin resistance, which can help regulate blood sugar levels as well (19Trusted Source).\nCoconut meat contains phenolic compounds, which are antioxidants that may help protect cells from oxidative damage.\nSome test-tube and animal studies have also shown that antioxidants found in coconut oil may help protect cells from damage and death caused by oxidative stress and chemotherapy (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nCoconut is a high-fat fruit that has a wide range of health benefits.\nHowever, coconut is very high in fat and calories, so watch your portion sizes if you are trying to lose weight or need to follow a low-fat diet.\nWhether you eat it raw, dried, or as flour, coconut meat is delicious and easy to incorporate into both sweet and savory dishes.\nHere are 10 ways that coconut oil can improve your health.\nResearch shows that coconut water can help with hydration, diabetes, heart health and more.\nCoconut oil was demonized in the past because it is high in saturated fat.\nThis article tells you whether you should drink coffee with\u2026 Coconut oil is a type of fat that has many health benefits.","1":"Research suggests that coconut meat provides nutritious fats and various other potential health benefits.\nThe meat is said to, among other things: Researchers have studied some, but not all, of the potential health benefits of coconut.\nCoconut meat contains large amounts of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a type of saturated fat that is much easier for the human body to digest than animal fats.\nThe MCFAs found in coconut meat also contain antimicrobial properties.\nAlthough eating coconut meat is not a substitute for proper dental hygiene, it can help kill some of the unwanted bacteria found in your mouth and protect your gums and teeth from infection or cavities.\nRegularly eating coconut meat might help with weight loss.\nThe MCFAs widely found in coconut meat are associated with fat burning.\nAlthough coconut meat provides highly valuable nutrients, the food contains moderate amounts of saturated fats, so it's best to enjoy it in moderation.\nIf you're looking to avoid or cut back on saturated fats, rather than using coconut meat as a snack, choose something that's high in healthy fats, like nuts, seeds, or avocados.","2":"In the United States, fresh whole coconut is considered an exotic food and is mostly consumed by health enthusiasts.\nDespite being high in saturated fat, coconuts provide manganese and fiber.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for one piece (45g) of fresh coconut meat measuring 2\" x 2\" x 1\/2\".\n1\ufeff One piece of fresh, unsweetened coconut meat has just 6.8 carbs, most of which is insoluble fiber\u2014an indigestible form of dietary carbohydrate.\nInsoluble fiber provides bulk to stool, and can help prevent constipation and the development of hemorrhoids.2\ufeff There is a small amount of naturally-occurring sugar in coconut, but just 2.8 grams per serving.\nThe glycemic load of a single serving of fresh coconut meat is estimated to be about 6.\nThere are 15 grams of fat in a single serving of coconut meat.\nCoconut is one of the highest plant-based sources of saturated fat.\nSaturated fat is the type mainly derived from meat protein.\nIt is associated with hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and heart disease.3\ufeff There has been substantial discussion in health and research settings about the relative risks and benefits of the different types of fat in coconut and coconut oil.\nCoconut provides medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs).4\ufeff MCFAs are considered by some to be healthier than long-chain fatty acids (found in meat and dairy sources).\nCoconut meat is not a rich source of protein, but it provides about 1.5 grams per piece.\nA single serving of coconut meat provides 34% of the daily value for manganese, a mineral that helps your body maintain a healthy brain, nervous system, and immune function.\nKeep in mind that while you may gain certain coconut oil benefits when you consume coconut meat.\nSome proponents of coconut oil believe that it is far better for your health than consuming other forms of saturated fat.\nThis type of fat breaks down faster and does not accumulate in the bloodstream as much as the long-chain fatty acids found in meat and dairy products.\nBut studies have shown that coconut oil can raise your LDL cholesterol.\nOne published study found that coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol less than butter, but significantly more than unsaturated plant oils.5\ufeff However, there is some potentially positive evidence regarding coconut oil and HDL levels.\nSome studies have found that consuming coconut oil can boost HDL levels.\nResearchers suggest that the HDL increase may be due to the high levels of both lauric acid and myristic acid.6\ufeff Research published in the July 2018 issue of the Journal of Food Science suggests that the fatty acids in coconut contain powerful antioxidants that help boost immune function and reduce systemic inflammation in the body.\nStudy authors note that these antioxidants may help protect the body from infections.7\ufeff Many fans of coconut and coconut oil claim that it can help you to slim down.\nA 2018 review of studies\u00a0supported certain weight-loss related claims, suggesting that the medium chain triglycerides in coconut and coconut oil could enhance fat burning, increased energy expenditure, and even\u00a0suppress appetite, but only if included as part of a low-fat diet.8\ufeff Another analysis of studies published in 2015 compared consumption of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) such as those found in coconut oil with long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) for the purposes of weight loss.\nStudy authors noted, however, that further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm these findings and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition.9\ufeff There are numerous controversial claims that coconut can prevent heart disease.\nMany of these claims are based on the fact that people from tropical areas where coconuts are widely consumed traditionally had a lower risk for heart disease.\nAccording to epidemiological research published in 1981, Tokelauans, for whom coconut represents 60% of the daily diet, had no evidence of heart disease or hypercholesterolemia despite the high intake of lauric and myristic acid.10\ufeff But researchers also point out that these people also ate diets rich in fish and plant foods.5\ufeff Many scientists now believe that the cardioprotective properties of coconut consumption have been exaggerated.11\ufeff In fact, a large review of studies found little evidence supporting the fact that consuming coconut or coconut oil (instead of unsaturated oil) reduced the risk for heart disease.5\ufeff More recent claims that coconut meat, coconut milk, or coconut oil can boost mental function in people with Alzheimer's disease remains largely unsupported.\nCoconut and coconut oil are known to provide antioxidants12\ufeff These antioxidants may help reduce oxidative stress and lower the risk of metabolic and aging-related diseases by eliminating free radicals that cause cell damage.13\ufeff Coconut allergy is rare but can occur, particularly in people with a known allergy to walnuts or other tree nuts.14\ufeff If an allergy were to occur, it would most likely be in the form of contact dermatitis, an allergic reaction caused when coconut or coconut oil comes into contact with skin.\nLess commonly, people may experience a food allergy after eating coconut.\nAnaphylaxis, a potentially deadly all-body reaction, is exceptionally rare when eating coconut, according to a 2017 study from Texas College Hospital.15\ufeff Even so, coconuts are classified as nuts by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and must be disclosed as a possible allergen on food product labels.\nThere are no known drug interactions to coconut or coconut oil.\nIt can take a lot of work to extract coconut meat from the whole fruit so many people purchase coconut either freshly shredded or dried and shredded.\nA one-ounce serving of dried shredded coconut has slightly more calories than a serving of fresh\u00a0coconut.\nA half-cup (100 grams) of shredded, sweetened coconut provides 500 calories, nearly 48 grams of carbohydrate, 43 grams of sugar, 35 grams of fat, and 2.8 grams of protein.17\ufeff The nutritional value of other coconut foods and beverages can vary substantially.\nOnce cracked open, refrigerate coconut meat for up to a week.\nShredded fresh coconut should be treated like a fresh whole coconut that has been cracked open.\nCoconut meat, fresh.\nSaturated fat, carbohydrate, and
