contain phytic acid, which has been shown to impair the absorption of some minerals, like iron and zinc, from the nuts (3Trusted Source).\nAntioxidants protect the body from oxidative stress, which can damage cell structure and promote aging, cancer and heart disease (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nEating nuts has been shown to protect the heart (13Trusted Source).\nIn hazelnuts, the high concentration of antioxidants and healthy fats may increase antioxidant potential and lower cholesterol levels in the blood (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nMoreover, a review of nine studies including over 400 people also saw reductions in bad LDL and total cholesterol levels in those who ate hazelnuts, while good HDL cholesterol and triglycerides remained unchanged (17Trusted Source).\nOther studies have shown similar effects on heart health, with results demonstrating lower blood fat levels and increased vitamin E levels (14Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nMoreover, the high content of fatty acids, dietary fiber, antioxidants, potassium and magnesium in hazelnuts seems to help normalize blood pressure (21Trusted Source).\nAmong other nuts like pecans and pistachios, hazelnuts have the highest concentration of a category of antioxidant known as proanthocyanidins (7Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, hazelnuts are rich in vitamin E, another powerful antioxidant that has exhibited possible protection against cell damage that could cause or promote cancer (24Trusted Source).\nManganese has shown to help the functions of specific enzymes that could reduce oxidative damage and decrease the risk of cancer (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, an animal study using a product made from hazelnut skin extract resulted in a decreased risk of colon cancer after the eight-week study period (29Trusted Source).\nOne study investigated how eating hazelnuts affected inflammatory markers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, in 21 people with high cholesterol levels.\nThe participants experienced significant reductions in inflammation after four weeks of following a diet in which hazelnuts accounted for 18\u201320% of their total calorie intake (16Trusted Source).\nMoreover, eating 60 grams of hazelnuts every day for 12 weeks helped reduce inflammatory markers in overweight and obese people (30Trusted Source).\nIt showed that eating 40 grams of hazelnuts may reduce the inflammatory response in healthy people (31Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, 50 people with metabolic syndrome experienced a decrease in inflammation after consuming 30 grams of a combination of raw nuts \u2014 15 grams walnuts, 7.5 grams almonds and 7.5 grams hazelnuts \u2014 for 12 weeks, compared to a control group (32Trusted Source).\nIn order to reduce inflammation, it is also important to follow a calorie-controlled diet (30Trusted Source).\nNuts, like almonds and walnuts, have been shown to help reduce blood sugar levels (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nOne study explored the effect of hazelnuts on fasting blood sugar levels in 48 people with type 2 diabetes.\nAfter eight weeks, the hazelnut group did not experience significant reductions in fasting blood sugar levels (36Trusted Source).\nAfter 12 weeks, the results showed a significant reduction in fasting insulin levels (32Trusted Source).\nA two-month study showed that a diet rich in oleic acid significantly reduced fasting blood sugar and insulin levels, while increasing insulin sensitivity, in 11 people with type 2 diabetes (39Trusted Source).\nIt seems that a diet rich in nuts, including hazelnuts, could help lower your blood sugar and increase insulin sensitivity.\nHazelnuts contain several compounds that may help lower blood sugar levels.\nHazelnuts are packed with nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, antioxidant compounds and healthy fats.\nThey may also have health benefits, including helping decrease blood fat levels, regulating blood pressure, reducing inflammation and improving blood sugar levels, among others.","1":"Hazelnuts\u00a0are the\u00a0hard-shelled nut of the hazelnut tree (Corylus avellana).\nHazelnuts can be eaten raw and this versatile nut is also used in both sweet and savory dishes.\nThese nuts offer health and nutrition benefits and can be a smart addition to your diet.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for 1 ounce\u00a0(28g or about 21 whole kernels) of unsalted hazelnuts.1\ufeff The standard serving of hazelnuts is 1 ounce or about 21 nuts.\nAccording to USDA data, one serving provides about 178 calories and just under 5 grams of carbohydrate.\nThere is a total of 17 grams of fat in a serving of the nuts.\nThere is a smaller amount (1.3 grams) of less healthy saturated fat.\nHazelnuts provide just over 4 grams of protein per serving.\nThere have been some studies linking nuts in general and hazelnuts specifically to certain health benefits as well.\nHazelnuts provide several benefits if you are trying to eat well and maintain a healthy weight.\nEating nuts instead of other starchy snacks such as chips or pretzels may help you to maintain a healthy weight.\nIn fact, a 2014 study showed that regular consumption of nuts (about one handful) can be incorporated as a component of a healthy diet for the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes when used as a replacement for less healthful foods.2\ufeff The significant amount of manganese in hazelnuts\u00a0also provides important health benefits.\nThe mineral also has antioxidant functions, is important for wound healing, sex hormone production, and bone development.3\ufeff Nuts are a high-fat food, but they provide healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat\u2014fats that help boost heart health when consumed in moderation.\nA large study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggested that higher consumption of certain types of nuts including hazelnuts was inversely associated with total cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.4\ufeff A study published in the journal\u00a0Nutrients found that a diet rich in hazelnuts was associated with a decrease in LDL and total cholesterol with steady levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and body mass index (BMI).5\ufeff These results are favorable for cardiovascular disease prevention.\nAnother study involving 66 adolescents and children with hyperlipidemia found that hazelnut\u00a0consumption could have a positive effect on their cholesterol levels.6\ufeff If you have any tree nut allergy you should avoid hazelnuts until you know that they are safe for you.\nIt is possible to have an allergy to one type of tree nut and have a reaction to others,\u00a0according to the\u00a0American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI).7\ufeff In those who have the allergy, reactions to hazelnuts\u00a0or other tree nuts can range from mild to severe and\u00a0may include life-threatening\u00a0anaphylaxis.\nSeek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider if you suspect that you may be allergic to hazelnuts\u00a0or other tree nuts.\nHazelnuts are also found in canned nut mixes that you find in the snack food aisles of the grocery store.\nThese added ingredients will change the nutritional profile of the nut.\nIf you buy shelled hazelnuts, find those that are heavy, full, and mold-free.\nSo, store hazelnuts in the shell if possible and they can last up to a year.\nTo remove hazelnut skins, wrap the nuts in a dish towel and let them sit for five to 10 minutes.\nTry one of these hazelnut recipes or substitute hazelnuts for another nut in other recipes.\nNuts, hazelnuts or filberts.\nLong-term associations of nut consumption with body weight and obesity.\nEffects of hazelnut consumption on blood lipids and

allergy.","2":"Hazelnut trees are relatively easy to grow and begin producing nuts within 4-6 years of being planted.\nIn addition to providing a quick source of energy and an easy source of plant-based protein, hazelnuts offer a variety of other health benefits.\nOmega-3s have a number of heart-healthy benefits and have been shown to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\nIn addition to their omega-3 content, hazelnuts are also packed with antioxidants that protect the body from oxidative stress that can contribute to hypertension.\nThey contain high amounts of phenolic compounds, which help your heart stay healthy by reducing cholesterol and inflammation.\nOxidative stress may increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer.\nManganese superoxide dismutase\u2014one of the antioxidant enzymes found in hazelnuts\u2014helps decrease oxidative stress and may help reduce your risk of developing cancer.\nHazelnuts also contain vitamin E, which helps protect cells against the types of cellular damage that can lead to cancer.\nProanthocyanidins are chemical compounds thought to help reduce the risk of cancer.\nJournal of the Japan
