environmental constraints to, and impacts of, sweetpotato and yam production systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA).\nThe review highlights crop-environment interactions at three stages of the sweetpotato\/yam value chain: pre-production (e.g., land clearing), production (e.g., soil, water, and input use), and post-production (e.g., waste disposal, crop storage and transport).\nIn particular, because sweetpotato and yam are vegetatively propagated, the most significant (and avoidable) environmental constraints to crop yields include disease and pest infection transmitted through the use of contaminated planting materials.\nThis review is one in a series that examines crop-environment\u00a0interactions drawing on both the academic literature and the\u00a0field expertise of crop scientists.","1":"Could Not Retrieve Summary.","2":"Life-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of sweet potato-based bioethanol production.\nResults show that the net energy ratio of sweet potato-based bioethanol is 1.48 and the net energy gain is 6.55\u00a0MJ\/L.\nIt is suggested that substituting coal with cleaner energy for steam generation in bioethanol conversion stage and promotion of better management practices in sweet potato cultivation stage could lead to a significant improvement of energy

Potatoes | Health.com"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"They come in a variety of sizes and colors \u2014 including orange, white, and purple \u2014 and are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.\nIn addition, sweet potatoes \u2014 especially the orange and purple varieties \u2014 are rich in antioxidants that protect your body from free radicals (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nTherefore, eating antioxidant-rich foods is good for your health (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nSummary Sweet potatoes are starchy root vegetables that are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\nTest-tube studies have found that antioxidants in purple sweet potatoes promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, including certain Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nAnthocyanins \u2014 a group of antioxidants found in purple sweet potatoes \u2014 have been found to slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells in test-tube studies, including those of the bladder, colon, stomach, and breast (3Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, mice fed diets rich in purple sweet potatoes showed lower rates of early-stage colon cancer \u2014 suggesting that the anthocyanins in the potatoes may have a protective effect (3Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nExtracts of orange sweet potatoes and sweet potato peels have also been found to have anti-cancer properties in test-tube studies (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nSummary Animal and test-tube research suggests that the anthocyanins and other antioxidants found in sweet potatoes may protect against certain cancers.\nIn fact, one cup (200 grams) of baked orange sweet potato with skin provides more than seven times the amount of beta-carotene that the average adult needs per day (2Trusted Source).\nEating foods rich in beta-carotene, such as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, may help prevent this condition (27Trusted Source).\nTest-tube studies have found that the anthocyanins they provide can protect eye cells from damage, which may be significant to overall eye health (28Trusted Source).\nSummary Sweet potatoes are rich in beta-carotene and anthocyanins, antioxidants that may help prevent vision loss and improve eye health.\nAnimal studies have found that the anthocyanins in purple sweet potatoes can protect the brain by reducing inflammation and preventing free radical damage (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nNo studies have been done to test these effects in humans, but in general, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants are associated with a 13% lower risk of mental decline and dementia (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nSummary Animal studies have shown that sweet potatoes may improve brain health by reducing inflammation and preventing mental decline.\nOrange-fleshed sweet potatoes are one of the richest natural sources of beta-carotene, a plant-based compound that is converted to vitamin A in your body (36Trusted Source).\nStudies have shown that vitamin A deficiency increases gut inflammation and reduces the ability of your immune system to respond properly to potential threats (39Trusted Source).\nNo studies have been conducted to determine whether sweet potatoes, in particular, have an effect on immunity, but eating them regularly can help prevent vitamin A deficiency (40Trusted Source).\nSummary Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which can be converted to vitamin A and help support your immune system and gut health.\nThey\u2019re high in fiber and antioxidants, which protect your body from free radical damage and promote a healthy gut and brain.\nThey\u2019re also incredibly rich in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A to support good vision and your immune system.","1":"It\u2019s rich in an antioxidant called beta carotene, which is very effective at raising blood levels of vitamin A, particularly in children (1, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw sweet potatoes are (5Trusted Source): A medium-sized sweet potato (boiled without the skin) contains 27 grams of carbs.\nSimple sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose, comprise 32% of the carb content (2Trusted Source).\nGiven the relatively high GI of sweet potatoes, large amounts in a single meal may be unsuitable for people with type 2 diabetes.\nThe starch proportions in sweet potatoes are as follows (8, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source): Cooked sweet potatoes are relatively high in fiber, with a medium-sized sweet potato containing 3.8 grams.\nSoluble fibers, such as pectin, may increase fullness, decrease food intake, and reduce blood sugar spikes by slowing your digestion of sugars and starches (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nA high intake of insoluble fibers has been associated with health benefits, such as a reduced risk of diabetes and improved gut health (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nThis root vegetable is also relatively low in protein but still an important protein source in many developing countries.\nSweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, vitamin C, and potassium.\nThe most abundant vitamins and minerals in this vegetable are (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source): Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, vitamin C, and potassium.\nThese include (12, 31, 32Trusted Source): Notably, the antioxidant activity of sweet potatoes increases with the color intensity of their flesh.\nThe absorption of vitamin C and some antioxidants increases in sweet potatoes after cooking, while levels of other plant compounds may decrease slightly (33Trusted Source, 34, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nThe two species contain similar amounts of water, carbs, fat, and protein (5Trusted Source).\nBoth are good sources of vitamin C and potassium, but sweet potatoes also provide excellent amounts of beta carotene, which your body can transform into vitamin A.\nBecause of their fiber and vitamin contents, sweet potatoes are often considered the healthier choice between the two.\nThey have a lower GI, more fiber, and large amounts of beta carotene.\nAs vitamin A plays an important role in your body, deficiency in this essential nutrient is a major public health issue in many developing countries (40Trusted Source).\nSweet potatoes are an excellent source of highly absorbable beta carotene, which your body can convert into vitamin A.\nThe intensity of the yellow or orange color of the sweet potato is directly linked to its beta carotene content (41Trusted Source).\nOrange sweet potatoes have been shown to increase blood levels of vitamin A more than other beta carotene sources, as they contain a highly absorbable variety of this nutrient (42Trusted Source).\nSweet potatoes may have a variety of benefits, including improved blood sugar regulation and reduced oxidative damage.\nHowever, they are considered fairly high in substances called oxalates, which may increase your risk of kidney stones (52Trusted Source).\nSweet potatoes are underground tubers that are excellent sources of beta carotene, as well as many other vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds.\nThis root vegetable may have several health benefits, such as improved blood sugar regulation and vitamin A levels.\nSweet potatoes are a popular root vegetable, packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.","2":"One cup of baked sweet potato provides nearly half of your daily vitamin C needs.\nA serving of sweet potato delivers a third of your need for manganese, a mineral that helps produce collagen and promote skin and bone health.\nSome may regard sweet potatoes as too starchy, but their high fiber content makes them a slow burning starch\u2014meaning they won\u2019t spike blood sugar and insulin levels.\nOne cup of baked sweet potato provides about 6 grams of fiber, which is more than a quarter of the daily recommended minimum.\nOne cup of sweet potato baked in its skin provides 950 mg of potassium.\nPotassium essentially sweeps excess sodium and fluid out of the body, which lowers blood pressure and reduces strain on the heart.\nAccording to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, less than 2% of Americans meet the daily recommended potassium target of 4,700 mg.\nAbout 12% of the starch in sweet potatoes is resistant starch, a filling, fiber-like substance your body doesn\u2019t digest and absorb."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/sweet-potato-benefits","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/sweet-potatoes","2":"www.health.com\/nutrition\/sweet-potato-health-benefits"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
