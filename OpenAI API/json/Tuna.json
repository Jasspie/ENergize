Better yet, look for pole-and-line caught fish, which has an even lower incidence of bycatch and bycatch mortality (source).\nYou can easily find eco-friendly fished skipjack using the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Seafood Watch site\u00a0(or download the app, which is linked on the home page).\nThey are usually fished using the same methods as skipjack.\nOnly eat sustainably-fished yellowfin (pole-and-line caught, or at least fished without FADs) if you must.\nAlbacore tuna inhabit a wide range of temperate and tropical waters and are usually sold canned.\nAgain, it is probably best to avoid eating albacore tuna to due its conservation status.\nIf you must eat it, look for pole-and-line caught fish.\nBigeye tuna live in subtropical and tropical waters and are sold fresh or frozen.\nEating bigeye in any form, fished in any manner is bad for the environment.\nPacific Bluefin tuna are estimated to be at less than 3% of their population.\nOverall: If you like tuna, buy sustainably-caught skipjack.\nThus, if tuna go extinct, it\u2019s not only possible but likely that populations of other species down their food chain swell and burst.","1":"Eco-label initiatives and programmes like Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Seafood Watch, meant to help hungry diners quickly select sustainably caught seafood, have been gathering public support in recent years, says Brandi McKuin at the University of California Merced.\nWhile those guides are helpful, their standards focus mainly on fishing-based factors, like leaving enough fish in the ocean to avoid decimating the population, and reducing the number of accidently caught fish, or bycatch, McKuin says.\nBy combing through published papers, reports, and online catch databases, McKuin and her colleague Elliott Campbell determined that tuna vessels using more sustainable methods such as troll and pole line fishing or longline fishing consume about three to four times as much fuel as boats that employ a large net called a purse seine.\nThat\u2019s because purse seining is more efficient, McKuin says \u2013 more fish can be gathered in a shorter amount of time \u2013 but it\u2019s also less sustainable than selective methods because other species get swept into the net, too.","2":"Some tuna is certified as sustainably caught by groups such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) that set standards for sustainable fishing.\nIn late August, several media outlets published stories about On the Hook, a new campaign by a consortium of retailers and academics who have taken issue with some fishing practices allowed by the MSC.\nSome of the tuna caught here carries the MSC\u2019s blue label, identifying it as the best environmental choice for consumers.\nBut rewarding fishermen for their sustainable catch, while allowing them to fish unsustainably, dupes consumers into supporting companies that take part in bad behaviour.\nFishermen can use nets to catch free-swimming adult tuna and earn MSC certification for their catch.\nFishing on FADs is faster and less costly, but these devices are associated with high levels of bycatch, one of the main sustainability concerns in many fisheries.\nFishing on FADs does not earn MSC certification.\n\u201cCompartmentalization\u201d is a technique that allows the unsustainable portion of the fish to be separated on board the vessel from the sustainable portion.\nIt costs fishermen more to fish sustainably because they have to find the tuna, instead of waiting for it to come to the FAD.\nIf purse-seining tuna vessels need to subsidize their sustainable fishing with unsustainable practices, then MSC certification has not provided the incentive it set out to.\nMillions of tonnes of tuna have been fished from the waters of the Western and Central Pacific fishery.\nFor example, PNA countries used to extract between three per cent and six per cent of the value of tuna fishery in their waters.\nIt would like the MSC to delay the recertification   \u2014 authorized by the accreditation body in September     \u2014 of the PNA fishery until the compartmentalization practice has been addressed.\nFor example, the MSC could specify that to earn a certification, a boat cannot fish sustainably and unsustainably on the same fishing trip.\nIn fact, it is the same boats, the same fleet, the same companies that are fishing MSC-certified tuna and on FADs. My colleagues also worry that the campaign calls into question the credibility of the MSC label.\nIt is no longer clear that fish carrying the MSC label offer the best environmental choice.\nConsumers need to know that the waters are muddy, that seafood sustainability is a moving target, and that it is not easy to make the right choice when standing in the aisle at the supermarket.\nMore than anything, the MSC needs to take a good look at itself and remember what it is supposed to represent   \u2014 the best environmental choice   \u2014 not consumer confusion."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.justtoclaireify.com\/is-eating-tuna-bad-for-the-environment\/","1":"www.newscientist.com\/article\/2116650-sustainable-tuna-fishing-is-bad-for-climate-heres-why\/","2":"theconversation.com\/heres-why-your-sustainable-tuna-is-also-unsustainable-83560"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"
