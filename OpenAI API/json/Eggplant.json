substances that help protect the body from damage caused by harmful substances known as free radicals (3Trusted Source).\nStudies have shown that antioxidants could help prevent many types of chronic disease, such as heart disease and cancer (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nEggplants are especially rich in anthocyanins, a type of pigment with antioxidant properties that\u2019s responsible for their vibrant color (6Trusted Source).\nIn fact, multiple test-tube studies have confirmed that it\u2019s effective at protecting cells against damage from harmful free radicals (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nThanks to their antioxidant content, some studies suggest that eggplants may help reduce the risk of heart disease.\nAt the end of the study, they had lower levels of both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, two blood markers that can lead to an increased risk of heart disease when elevated (9Trusted Source).\nSome animal studies have found that eggplants may improve heart function and reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, though human research is needed.\nOther research suggests that polyphenols, or natural plant compounds, found in foods like eggplant may reduce sugar absorption and increase insulin secretion, both of which can help lower blood sugar (13Trusted Source).\nEggplants fit well into current dietary recommendations for controlling diabetes, which include a high-fiber diet rich in whole grains and vegetables (15Trusted Source).\nEggplants are high in fiber and polyphenols, both of which may help reduce blood sugar levels.\nEggplants are high in fiber and low in calories, making them an excellent addition to any weight loss regimen.\nFiber moves through the digestive tract slowly and can promote fullness and satiety, reducing calorie intake (16Trusted Source).\nEggplant is high in fiber but low in calories, both of which can help promote weight loss.\nSome animal studies have shown that SRGs could cause the death of cancer cells and may also help reduce the recurrence of certain types of cancer (17Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, several studies have found that eating more fruits and vegetables, such as eggplant, may protect against certain types of cancer.\nOne review looking at approximately 200 studies found that eating fruits and vegetables was associated with protection against pancreatic, stomach, colorectal, bladder, cervical and breast cancer (21Trusted Source).\nEating more fruits and vegetables may also protect against some types of cancer.\nThis can reduce your carb and calorie intake, all while increasing the fiber and nutrient content of your meal.\nEggplant is a high-fiber, low-calorie food that is rich in nutrients and comes with many potential health benefits.\nFrom reducing the risk of heart disease to helping with blood sugar control and weight loss, eggplants are a simple and delicious addition to any healthy diet.","1":"Dig a little deeper at your local farmers market and you're likely to find oval, long and slim, and melon-shaped eggplants with white, green, pink, orange, and even striped skin.\nWhen you cut one open, you'll find meaty white flesh, maybe with a hint of green or yellow, dotted with small clusters of beige seeds.\nThe eggplant is a nightshade vegetable, like potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers.\nEggplant has a rich, meaty inside that takes on a creamy consistency when you cook it.\nAnd at just 25 calories and less than 1 gram of fat per serving, it's a pretty guilt-free food -- as long as you don't soak it in oil.\nEggplant has antioxidants like vitamins A and C, which help protect your cells against damage.\nIt's also high in natural plant chemicals called polyphenols, which may help cells do a better job of processing sugar if you have diabetes.\nEggplant and other nightshade vegetables have the chemical solanine, which some people claim adds to inflammation and makes diseases like arthritis worse.\nBefore you cook eggplant, wash it and cut off both ends.\nRinse off the salt before you cook it.\nWhen it's cut up, it makes a good addition to curries and soups.\nAnd, of course, a favorite recipe is eggplant parmesan, but keep in mind that rolling eggplant in breadcrumbs and frying it in oil will add calories and fat.\nDon't cut an eggplant until you're ready to cook it.\nArthritis Foundation: \"Best Vegetables for

eggplant nutrition.\nIt is a vegetable with a lot to offer: a high amount of\u00a0antioxidants, special phytonutrients, including phenolic compounds, flavonoids, such as\u00a0nasunin, and numerous vitamins and minerals too.\nAnd all of these eggplant nutrition benefits come at a low calorie count of only 35 calories per cup, thanks to its\u00a0high fiber and water content.\nEggplant, a member of the nightshade and\u00a0Solanaceae\u00a0plant family, is considered by researchers to be a part of a group of valuable crops due to their anthocyanin antioxidant compounds, which can be seen in its rich purple\u00a0colors.\nIt contains a somewhat rare and extremely beneficial type of antioxidant known as nasunin.\nNasunin is a type of\u00a0anthocyanin\u00a0antioxidant found in all types of\u00a0eggplant varieties, in addition to other deeply colored fruits and vegetables.\nNasunin is one of the key contributors to the health benefits of eggplant nutrition.\nMost of the nasunin present within this veggie\/fruit is found in its purple skin, so consuming the entire vegetable, including its peel, is important to reap all the health benefits.\nToday there are seven main types that are harvested and made available throughout most \u201cWestern\u201d countries, including the most popular types, the Italian (large, purple oval) and small Japanese eggplant.\nThe health benefits of eggplant nutrition seem to be consistent across the different types, with the exception of the variety known as \u201cblack magic\u201d eggplant.\nSome sources have found that black magic eggplants can have up to three times the amount of antioxidant phenolics as the other types, although more research is needed to confirm the exact differences.\nAs mentioned above, one of the most studied eggplant health benefits is this veggie\u2019s rich source of antioxidants.\nNasunin is one antioxidant involved in the ability to help cells receive and use nutrients from food and to discard of waste.\nWithout enough antioxidants like nasunin present within the body, toxins and waste build up and can lead to a host of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis and more.\nEggplant nutrition contains disease-fighting nasunin, as previously mentioned, in addition to many other phytonutrients, like chlorogenic acid.\nChlorogenic acid is type of polyphenol that has been linked with benefits such as regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.\nStudies\u00a0show that eggplant has anti-hypertensive effects and can be beneficial for heart health due to its ability to fight inflammation and oxidative stress.\nEggplant nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining healthy normal\u00a0cholesterol levels\u00a0because of its phytonutrients\u2019 ability to improve circulation and reduce plaque buildup in the main arteries, including the aorta.\nAccording to research done by the Royal Society of Chemistry, some studies show that eggplants containing potent cardio-protective compounds judging by their ability to increase left ventricular function (one of the main blood-pumping chambers of the heart) and reduce apoptosis.\nConsuming vegetables that have a high content of water,\u00a0fiber and nutrients helps flush out waste and toxins from the digestive tract.\nBecause of the known benefits of eggplant nutrition, this veggie\/fruit is included in the\u00a0GAPS diet.\nLike other fruits\/vegetables, it\u2019s a source of mostly carbohydrates, but it also contains fiber \u2014 which means it can help make you feel full, so you are less likely to overeat.\nEggplant nutrition provides a good source of vitamin B1 and vitamin B6, two of the vitamins that are included in the healthy metabolism and energy-promoting B vitamin complex.\nB vitamins are water-soluble, found in many vegetables and other whole food sources, and are needed to maintain healthy\u00a0energy\u00a0levels, brain function, metabolism, heart health and focus.\nVitamin B1, meanwhile, is used for maintain a healthy metabolism, blood and heart health, brain function, and more.\nThe leaves are edible but not very flavorful, plus they contain compounds called solanine, which when consumed in very high amounts (which is unlikely) may cause some health issues.\nIt\u2019s fine to eat raw eggplant, although cooking it enhances its nutrient availability, texture and taste.\nCooked eggplant, which is normally the type that most people eat as opposed to raw, has been shown in studies to have even more benefits.\nCooking it results in even more available antioxidant content and biological activity of beneficial properties, as the thermal effect further releases disease-fighting compounds.\nOther nightshade vegetables include tomatoes, bell peppers and various types of potatoes.\nNightshade vegetables are known for causing digestive disturbances in some people.\nNightshade vegetables are high in oxalic acid, which has been correlated with an increased risk for forming\u00a0kidney stones\u00a0and\u00a0arthritis\u00a0in some people.\nSome people report feeling better after removing nightshade vegetables from their diets, suffering from less digestive distress and other inflammatory symptoms, including arthritis.\nWhat studies have shown is that eggplant does tend to be a common allergen for some people, and all types seem to have the same negative effects in those who react to negatively to this veggie\/fruit due to allergies.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and healthy
