factors, prevent kidney stones, aid iron absorption, and promote healthy skin.\nEating lime fruit or drinking lime juice provides a variety of health benefits.\nIn high amounts, free radicals can damage your cells, and this damage has been linked to chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and many types of cancer (2Trusted Source).\nLimes are high in active compounds that function as antioxidants in your body, including flavonoids, limonoids, kaempferol, quercetin, and ascorbic acid (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nLimes are high in vitamin C, a nutrient that may help boost your immune system.\nIn test-tube studies, vitamin C helped increase the production of white blood cells, which help protect your body against infections and disease (5Trusted Source).\nBesides vitamin C, limes are also a great source of antioxidants, which help strengthen your immune system by defending cells against free radical damage (2Trusted Source).\nFor instance, one study in over 4,000 women found that those who ate more vitamin C had a lower risk of wrinkles and dry skin as they aged (10Trusted Source).\nSecond, limes are high in antioxidants, which may help combat age-related skin changes.\nA mouse study found that drinking a citrus drink positively affected some of these signs by reducing wrinkles and increasing collagen production, for example (11Trusted Source).\nFor starters, limes are high in vitamin C, which may help lower high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease (13Trusted Source).\nAn animal study found that feeding rabbits lime peels and juice helped slow down the progression of atherosclerosis (15Trusted Source).\nThey can form inside your kidneys when your urine is very concentrated or when you have high levels of stone-forming minerals, such as calcium, in your urine (16Trusted Source).\nCitrus fruits like limes are high in citric acid, which may prevent kidney stones by raising levels of citrate and binding stone-forming minerals in the urine (17Trusted Source).\nOne study found that people who ate more citrus fruits had a significantly lower risk of kidney stones (18Trusted Source).\nSigns of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, trouble breathing during exercise, paleness, and dry skin and hair (19Trusted Source).\nFoods high in vitamin C, such as limes, may help prevent iron deficiency anemia by improving the absorption of iron from plant-based foods.\nFor instance, one study in people following a vegetarian diet found that drinking a glass of lemonade (8.5 ounces or 250 ml) alongside a plant-based meal increased iron absorption by up to 70% (21Trusted Source).\nCitrus fruits have compounds that have been linked to a lower risk of certain cancers (22Trusted Source).\nIn particular, flavonoids \u2014 which act as antioxidants \u2014 may help stop the expression of genes that promote cancer progression (23Trusted Source).\nLimes may help improve immunity, reduce heart disease risk factors, prevent kidney stones, aid iron absorption, promote healthy skin, and lower your risk of certain cancers.\nHowever, if you\u2019re allergic to other citrus fruits, avoid limes as they can cause food allergy symptoms, such as swelling, hives, and breathing difficulties.\nEating many limes can increase your risk of cavities, as the acid in limes \u2014 and other citrus fruits \u2014 can erode tooth enamel (29Trusted Source).\nLimes are high in vitamin C and antioxidants \u2014 both of which may offer health benefits.\nEating limes or drinking the juice may improve immunity, reduce heart disease risk factors, prevent kidney stones, aid iron absorption, and promote healthy skin.\nThis article reviews the similarities and differences between lemons and limes \u2014 so you\u2019ll know\u2026 Citrus fruits are not only flavorful and pretty \u2014 they\u2019re also good for you, offering several health benefits.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.","1":"This incredible citrus fruit may seem pretty ordinary, but it\u2019s actually a powerhouse of nutrition.\nBursting with both vitamin C and antioxidants, limes \u2014 like lemons \u2014 possess a powerful set of health benefits.\nIn fact, limes may be able to help amp up weight loss, enhance immunity, boost iron absorption, prevent kidney stones, improve heart health and even fight off cancer.\nBest of all, this fruit is widely available and easy to add into your diet, making it the perfect way to give your health an easy upgrade with minimal effort required.\n(1) Studies show that eating lime fruit could reduce several heart disease risk factors and may help give your heart health a boost.\nOne animal study in Iran, for example, showed that treating rabbits with lime juice and lime peels helped slow the progression of atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque on the artery walls.\nA study published in the\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine\u00a0looked at the diets of 126,399 adults over an eight- to 14-year period and found that each serving of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 4 percent\u00a0decreased risk of\u00a0coronary heart disease.\nResearchers also noted that leafy green vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruits and veggies, like limes, had the greatest impact.\n(3) For best results when it comes to heart health, include limes as part of a balanced diet and combine with a healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity.\nThis is because limes are jam-packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that fight against the harmful free radicals that can cause cell damage and chronic disease.\n(5) Other test-tube studies have shown that lime may be effective against other types of cancer as well, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.\n(9) Pair limes with a nutritious diet full of fruits and vegetables, limit your intake of ultra-processed foods, and squeeze in some exercise a few times per week to see the most results when you step on the scale.\nGetting enough vitamin C in your diet is important for many aspects of health, but it\u2019s especially crucial when it comes to immunity.\nOne review published in the\u00a0Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism\u00a0found that meeting your vitamin C needs could help reduce the duration and severity of respiratory tract infections and could also help prevent and improve the outcomes for malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.\nIncluding a few servings of lemons or limes in your diet is one of the easiest ways to kick kidney stones to the curb.\nLike lemons, limes contain a good amount of citric acid, a type of acid that can help prevent kidney stones by increasing urinary citrate and urine volume.\n(12) Although there is limited research looking at the effects of limes on kidney stones specifically, there are many studies showing that increasing your citric acid intake could be beneficial in kidney stone prevention.\n(13) You can also help prevent kidney stones by increasing your fluid intake, eating plenty of magnesium-rich foods and following a plant-based diet.\nA deficiency of this important mineral can result in iron deficiency anemia, a condition that causes anemia symptoms like dizziness, brittle nails, hair loss and fatigue.\nThe vitamin C found in limes can actually help increase iron absorption to prevent iron deficiency anemia.\nIn fact,\u00a0a study published in the\u00a0American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\u00a0even found that consuming 100 milligrams of vitamin C with a meal increased iron absorption by 67 percent.\n(14) To maximize your iron absorption, make sure your meals contain a good mix of iron-rich foods, like meat, lentils and spinach, along with plenty of vitamin C foods, such as limes.\nGiven their similarities in taste and nutrition, it\u2019s easy to understand why so many people mix up these two citrus fruits.\nThey\u2019re both packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, supply similar benefits to health, and are both used to bring a bit of flavor and zing to recipes.\nThe lemon nutrition profile is also a bit more substantial, with higher amounts of several micronutrients like vitamin B6 and folate.\nThey are also widely available at most grocery stores and can be found in the produce aisle, usually right next to the lemons and other citrus fruits.\nScurvy is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency, which can result in symptoms like bleeding gums, bruising and fatigue.\n(16) In 1747, scientist James Lind began conducting experiments on board a naval ship and discovered that drinking lemon and lime juice could help ward off scurvy thanks to the high concentration of vitamin C.\nAlthough uncommon, citrus fruit allergies are can cause\u00a0food allergy symptoms\u00a0like hives, swelling, asthma and flushed skin.","2":"Whether sweet or sour, limes have many health benefits.\nThe high levels of Vitamin C found in limes can help protect you from infection and speed up your body\u2019s healing process.\nCitrus fruits have been shown to help keep kidney stones at bay.\nThe citric acid in lemons, limes, and other citrus fruits makes it more difficult for kidney stones to form.\nStudies have shown that the flavonoids found in citrus fruit, including limes, may help protect against stroke, especially in women.\nRegularly eating limes, which are high in Vitamin C, can even help you stave off the common cold.\nCitrus fruits have many health benefits, and limes are no exception.\nLimes also contain small amounts of: Like other citrus fruits, limes are acidic and can damage your tooth enamel when eaten in large quantities.\nIf you're allergic to other citrus fruits, you might be allergic to limes."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/limes","1":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/limes\/","2":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-limes"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":"
