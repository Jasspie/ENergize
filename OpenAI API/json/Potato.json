many crops, potatoes are likely to be affected by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, temperature and precipitation, as well as interactions between these factors.[1] As well as affecting potatoes directly, climate change will also affect the distributions and populations of many potato diseases and pests.\nPotato plants and potato crop yields are predicted to benefit from increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.[3]\nAs a result, the water use efficiency (the amount of carbon assimilated per unit water lost) of potato plants is predicted to increase.[1] Potatoes grow best under temperate conditions.[4] Tuber growth and yield can be severely reduced by temperature fluctuations outside 5-30\u00a0\u00b0C.[5] \nAt low temperatures potatoes are at risk of frost damage, which can reduce growth and badly damage tubers.[1] In areas where potato growth is currently limited or impossible due to risks of frost damage (e.g. at high altitudes and in high latitude countries such as Russia and Canada), rising temperatures will likely benefit potato crops by extending the growing season and extending potential potato growing land.[5] Climate change predictions by the IPCC include likely changes to water resource availability across much of the globe.[6] In many areas water resources are expected to decrease, particularly in semi-arid areas.[1] Increases in extreme weather events including flash flooding are predicted, even in areas where overall average rainfall is predicted to decrease.[1] Potatoes are sensitive to soil water deficits compared to other crops such as wheat,[8] and need frequent irrigation, especially while tubers are growing.\nThese include: Adaptation of potato farming practices and potato varieties to changing conditions caused by climate change could help maintain crop yields and allow potato to be grown in areas with predicted conditions unsuited to current commercial potato cultivars.\nMethods to adapt potatoes to climate change include shifting production areas, improving water use and breeding new tolerant potato varieties.\nIn some countries reductions in yields caused by increased temperatures and decreased water availability could be avoided to a high degree by shifting potato production areas.[4]\nThere are also many varieties of Solanum tuberosum with potentially useful genetic material that are endemic to the Andes, the commercial potato's original habitat.[16] Listed below are some examples of potato cultivars, hybrids and related species that have traits that may help reduce the negative direct and indirect impacts of climate change on potato production."},"environment_urls":{"0":"experts.umn.edu\/en\/publications\/environmental-impacts-of-potato-nutrient-management","1":"humanitiespotato.weebly.com\/environmental-impact.html","2":"en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Climate_change_and_potatoes"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

the variety and how they are prepared.\nWhen free radicals accumulate, they can increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer (5Trusted Source).\nFor example, a test-tube study found that the antioxidants present in potatoes may suppress the growth of liver and colon cancer cells (6Trusted Source).\nInstead, it reaches the large intestine where it becomes a source of nutrients for the beneficial bacteria in your gut (9Trusted Source).\nResearch has linked resistant starch to many health benefits, including reducing insulin resistance, which, in turn, improves blood sugar control.\nIn an animal study, mice fed resistant starch showed reduced insulin resistance.\nThis means their bodies were more efficient at removing excess sugar from the blood (10Trusted Source).\nA study of people with type 2 diabetes found consuming a meal with resistant starch helped better remove excess blood sugar after a meal (11Trusted Source).\nIn another study, ten people were fed 30 grams of resistant starch daily over a four-week period.\nScientists found that resistant starch reduced insulin resistance by 33% (12Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, you can also increase the resistant starch content of potatoes.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition The resistant starch in potatoes may also improve digestive health.\nWhen resistant starch reaches the large intestine, it becomes food for beneficial gut bacteria.\nThese bacteria digest it and turn it into short-chain fatty acids (14Trusted Source).\nResistant starch from potatoes is mostly converted into the short-chain fatty acid butyrate \u2014 the preferred food source for gut bacteria (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nSome potato dishes that contain gluten include certain au gratin recipes and potato bread.\nIn one study, 11 people were fed 38 common foods and asked to rate foods based on how filling they were.\nIn fact, potatoes were rated as being seven times more filling than croissants, which were ranked as the least filling food item (21Trusted Source).\nFoods that are filling may help you regulate or lose weight, as they curb hunger pains (22Trusted Source).\nStudies have linked potatoes and their nutrients to a variety of impressive health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, reduced heart disease risk and higher immunity.\nPotatoes are also quite filling, which means they may help you lose weight by curbing hunger pains and cravings.\nHere's all you need to know about green potatoes and whether they're safe\u2026 Resistant starch is a carb with several health benefits.\nInterestingly, cooling foods like potatoes, rice and pasta may increase their resistant\u2026 For optimal health, it is a good idea to choose the foods that contain the most nutrients.\nThis article explains what foods to eat and avoid on a gluten-free diet and includes a delicious\u2026 Resistant starches are starch molecules that resist digestion, functioning kind of like fiber.","1":"Prepared the right way, potatoes can make a delicious, satisfying, and healthy dish.\nPotatoes are a good source of fiber, which can help you lose weight by keeping you full longer.\nPotatoes are also full of antioxidants that work to prevent diseases and vitamins that help your body function properly.\nThe fiber found in potatoes is a special type called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d which has the health benefits of both soluble fiber and insoluble fiber and causes less gas than other types of fiber.\nYou can up the amount of resistant starch in potatoes by cooking them a day ahead of time and cooling them in the fridge overnight.\nLike soluble fiber, the resistant starch in potatoes acts as a prebiotic \u2013 food for good bacteria in the large intestine that improves gut health.\nOn top of that, the skin of the potato can have up to 12 times more antioxidants than the flesh.\nSo, don\u2019t be afraid to eat your potato skins.\nBaked potato skin is a great source of potassium and magnesium.\nOr top a baked potato with lower-fat, high-protein options such as homemade chili or taco meat, black beans, corn, and salsa.\nA large order of French fries has over four times as many calories and 23 more grams of fat than the potato from which it was made.\nPotato chips, tater tots, and hash browns are also usually deep-fried in oil.\nNew potatoes roasted with 1 tsp rosemary and 1\/8 tsp pepper per pound make an elegant side dish.\n1. Cut each potato into four pieces and place all in a large pot.\n3. For each pound of potatoes, add 1\/8 cup olive oil, \u00bd tsp minced garlic, \u00bd tsp of salt, and a dash of pepper.\n3. Place potatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet and cook until skins are a little bit wrinkly, about 25 minutes.\nPlace the potatoes back on the baking sheet with the opposite side up.\n5. Bake for 20 more minutes, then put on an oven mitt and squeeze a potato to see if it's soft.","2":"Cooked potatoes with skin are a good source of many vitamins and minerals, such as potassium and vitamin C.\nAside from being high in water when fresh, potatoes are primarily composed of carbs and contain moderate amounts of protein and fiber \u2014 but almost no fat.\nCooling potatoes after cooking may lessen their effect on blood sugar and lower their GI by 25\u201326% (8Trusted Source, 9).\nEven though potatoes are not a high-fiber food, they may provide a significant source of fiber for those who eat them regularly.\nThey also contain varying amounts of resistant starch, a type of fiber that feeds the friendly bacteria in your gut and improves digestive health (12Trusted Source).\nCompared to hot potatoes, cooled ones offer higher amounts of resistant starch (8Trusted Source).\nPotatoes are low in protein, ranging from 1\u20131.5% when fresh and 8\u20139% by dry weight (10Trusted Source, 14).\nHowever, the protein quality of potatoes is very high for a plant \u2014 higher than that of soybeans and other legumes (10Trusted Source).\nThe main protein in potatoes is called patatin, which may cause allergic reactions in some people (15Trusted Source).\nPotatoes also contain small amounts of high-quality protein.\nPotatoes are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, particularly potassium and vitamin C.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Potatoes are rich in bioactive plant compounds, which are mostly concentrated in the skin.\nPotatoes harbor some healthy antioxidants that are responsible for many of their health benefits and mostly concentrated in the skin.\nPotatoes contain a number of minerals and plant compounds that may help lower blood pressure.\nRelative to other carb-rich foods, potatoes are particularly filling.\nOne study of 40 common foods found potatoes to be the most filling (28Trusted Source).\nAnother small trial in 11 men showed that eating boiled potatoes as a side with pork steak led to less calorie intake during the meal when compared to pasta or white rice (29Trusted Source).\nStudies indicate that proteinase inhibitor 2 (PI2), a potato protein, may suppress appetite (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nPlants of the nightshade family, such as potatoes, contain a class of toxic phytonutrients known as glycoalkaloids.\nGlycoalkaloid poisoning after eating potatoes has been reported in both people and animals (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nA 154-pound (70-kg) individual would have to eat over 13 cups (2 kg) of potatoes (with the skin) in one day to get a lethal dose (37Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s best to avoid eating potato sprouts (37Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nPotato varieties containing high amounts of glycoalkaloids \u2014 over 25 mg per cup (200 mg per kg) \u2014 cannot be marketed commercially, and some varieties have been banned (37Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nThey are found in fried, baked, or roasted potatoes, but not fresh, boiled, or steamed ones (46Trusted Source).\nCompared to other foods, french fries and potato chips are very high in acrylamides (48Trusted Source).\nFor optimal health, it seems sensible to limit your consumption of french fries and potato chips.\nThe main reason for this is that potatoes are widely consumed as french fries and potato chips \u2014 high-fat foods that harbor a number of unhealthy compounds.\nObservational studies link the consumption of fried potatoes and potato chips to weight gain (68Trusted Source, 69Trusted Source).\nFried potatoes and potato chips may also contain acrylamides, glycoalkaloids, and high amounts of salt, which all may be harmful over time (45, 70Trusted Source, 71Trusted Source).\nFor this reason, high consumption of fried potatoes \u2014 especially french fries and chips \u2014 should be avoided.\nPotatoes may contain a number of unhealthy compounds \u2014 particularly when fried.\nLimit your consumption of french fries and chips, and never eat potato sprouts.\nPotatoes are a popular high-carb food that provides several healthy vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-potatoes","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-potatoes","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/potatoes"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":" 50","2":"\n"}}
