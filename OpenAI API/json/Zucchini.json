plants was found to be significantly affected by the interaction between temperature (three different regimes: 16\u201318; 18\u201322; 22\u201326\u00b0C), CO2 (two concentrations: 400\u2013450 and 800\u2013850\u00a0ppm) and the treatments.\nAmong the resistant inducers that were tested, calcium oxide was the most effective, in terms of powdery mildew control under all the conditions tested in phytotrons, reducing disease severity from 46% to 61%.\nThe results obtained under our experimental conditions show that a possible increase in CO2 concentration and temperature, which is expected for the next few years, should not influence the efficacy of the tested resistance inducers or of sulphur against powdery mildew on zucchini.","1":"","2":"The objective of this research was to study the effect of the soil matric potential level on the bio-productivity of zucchini crop, the water use efficiency (WUE) and nutrients use efficiency by changing the threshold of soil matric potential.\nYield, leaf area, biomass, water consumption, WUE and nutrients, drainage volume and physical-chemical parameters of the soil were determined.\nThe results show that T2 slightly reduced the weight of the fruit with respect to T1, but not the number of fruit, obtaining a significantly lower consumption of water.\nReducing the soil moisture tension level increased substantially water consumption as a result of the differences in vegetative growth (leaf area and biomass) in plants.\nIndependently of soil matric potential, increased soil salinity occurred after the growing season.\nThe soil matric potential of \u221225\u00a0kPa was the best considering agronomic and environmental aspects, as the most efficient use of water and nutrients obtaining a commercial production of

Nutrients, Preparation, and More"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Zucchini is rich in several vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial plant compounds.\nZucchini contains a variety of vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds.\nThese may benefit your eyes, skin, and heart, as well as offer some protection against certain types of cancer, such as prostate cancer (4Trusted Source).\nYellow zucchinis may contain slightly higher levels than light green ones (5, 6Trusted Source).\nInsoluble fiber adds bulk to stools and helps food move through your gut more easily, further reducing constipation risk.\nZucchini is rich in water and fiber, two compounds which can promote healthy digestion by reducing your risk of constipation and symptoms of various gut disorders.\nZucchini may help lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\nLow-carb diets can significantly lower blood sugar and insulin levels, both of which may keep blood sugar levels stable and reduce the need for medication in people with type 2 diabetes (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nDiets rich in fiber from fruits and vegetables \u2014 including zucchini \u2014 are consistently linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (14Trusted Source).\nThe fiber found in zucchini may also help increase insulin sensitivity, which can help stabilize blood sugar as well (15Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, animal studies note that zucchini peel extract may help reduce blood sugar and insulin levels.\nZucchini\u2019s fiber may increase insulin sensitivity and stabilize blood sugar levels, potentially reducing your risk of type 2 diabetes.\nObservational studies show that people who eat more fiber have a lower risk of heart disease (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nPectin, one type of soluble fiber found in zucchini, appears particularly effective at reducing total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol levels (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nZucchini is also rich in potassium, which may help reduce high blood pressure by dilating your blood vessels.\nMoreover, diets rich in carotenoids \u2014 likewise found in zucchini \u2014 appear particularly protective against heart disease (26Trusted Source).\nThe fiber, potassium, and carotenoids in zucchini may lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and other risk factors for heart disease.\nThat\u2019s partly because zucchini is rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene \u2014 two nutrients important for eye health (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that these antioxidants can accumulate in your retina, improving your vision and reducing your risk of age-related eye diseases (29Trusted Source).\nIn addition, diets high in lutein and zeaxanthin may also lower your likelihood of developing cataracts, a clouding of the lens which can lead to poor eyesight (32Trusted Source).\nZucchini is rich in manganese, lutein, zeaxanthin, and vitamins A and C \u2014 nutrients which contribute to healthy vision and may lower your risk of age-related eye conditions.\nThis fruit is rich in water and has a low calorie density, which may help you feel full (33Trusted Source).\nIts fiber content may also reduce hunger and keep your appetite at bay (34Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, intake of non-starchy, dark green or yellow vegetables \u2014 with similar nutrition profiles to zucchini \u2014 appears particularly beneficial to weight loss (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nZucchini is rich in water and fiber yet low in calories, all of which may help reduce hunger and help you feel full \u2014 potentially leading to weight loss over time.\nZucchini is a versatile squash rich in vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds.\nIt may offer several health benefits, ranging from improved digestion to a lower risk of heart disease.","1":"These nine zucchini benefits \u2014 including improving digestion, slowing aging, and more \u2014 will show you why this summer squash deserves a place on your plate.\nZucchini contains zero fat, and is high in water and fiber.\nThis makes zucchini, also known as courgette, a nutrient-dense food that you should include in your diet.\nIncorporating zucchini in your diet can help improve digestion including reducing the incidence of constipation and other digestive issues.\nIt also contains significant amounts of fiber, electrolytes, and other nutrients that are necessary for a healthy digestive system.\nAging results from the activity of toxins, free radicals, and inflammation that the body is exposed to over the years.\nThese poisons and inflammation can be reduced by antioxidants and anti-inflammatory foods.\nZucchini is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, which help rid the body of free radicals and excess inflammation.\nHigh blood sugar levels and diabetes are problems that are worsened by a diet high in (unhealthy) carbohydrates and low in fiber.\nBy including zucchini in your diet, you increase the intake of fiber.\nThese diet changes can help reduce your blood sugar levels and increase insulin sensitivity.\nStudies show that including at least 30 grams of fiber in your daily diet lowers your risk of getting diabetes significantly.\nLow sodium and high potassium help to maintain healthy blood pressure while fiber, such as the polysaccharide in zucchini, lowers cholesterol levels.\nZucchini is a good source of health-protecting antioxidants and phytonutrients, including vitamin C, beta-carotene, manganese, zeaxanthin, and lutein.\nBecause zucchini is a rich source of B-vitamins, especially folate, riboflavin, and B6, it can help to boost energy production in the body.\nBecause zucchini is low in calories and high in water and fiber, it is a great food for those wishing to reduce their body weight.\nIt is worth noting that excess body weight usually results from regular consumption of carbohydrate and sugary foods.\nBy including zucchini in your diet, you increase the fiber and water content of your food.\nZucchini is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, including vitamins A and C, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase.\nEating zucchini regularly reduces oxidation and inflammation within the body.","2":"The mild flavor of this summer squash pairs well with a wide variety of recipes.\nMany enthusiasts prize zucchini for its limited calories and high nutrient content.\nElongated varieties of squash began to appear in Italian kitchens as early as the 1600s, but the first description of the produce with the name \"zucchini\" did not appear until the early 1900s.\nZucchini is packed with many important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nFiber plays an important role in digestion and may limit the likelihood of suffering from a variety of GI issues.\nZucchini contains zeaxanthin and several other compounds that can play a role in preventing oxidative stress.\nThe vitamin may even play a protective role against diabetes.\nZucchini is rich in multiple antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin.\nDespite packing a punch with several important nutrients, Zucchini is low in calories, fat, and sugar.\n\"Vitamin B6 and Diabetes\u2014Relationship and Molecular Mechanisms.\" Nutrients: \"Role of Zucchini and Its Distinctive Components in the Modulation of Degenerative Processes:
