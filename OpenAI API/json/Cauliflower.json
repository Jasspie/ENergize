health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nDoes cauliflower have a high or low carbon footprint?\nCauliflower has a low carbon footprint.\nIt takes around 0.31 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of fresh cauliflower, a car driving equivalent of 0.75 miles or 1.25 kilometers, USA market data.\nFood not only has a water footprint but also a carbon footprint, known as CO2e, which stands for carbon dioxide equivalent.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is

killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nIs cauliflower a product that has known labor issues?\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply
