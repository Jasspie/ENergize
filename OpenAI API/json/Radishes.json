Fiber also may help manage blood sugar levels.\nRadishes are high in potassium, which can help lower your blood pressure.\nRadishes are also thought to control damage to red blood cells and help increase oxygen supply to the blood.\nAre radishes good for your liver?\nRadishes can be very good for the liver and stomach as they act as a powerful detoxifier.\nRadishes reduce the destruction of red blood cells caused by jaundice by increasing the supply of fresh oxygen to the blood."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"raddishkids.com","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-radish","2":"www.tasteofhome.com\/collection\/radish-health-benefits\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 50","1":" 70","2":" 50"}}
