everywhere, not simply in this situation.","2":"This is made possible by our integrated-viticulture approach, which puts aside any notion of cultivating the vines isolated from their surrounding environment and relying on constant external inputs.\nOn the contrary, we look on the vineyard as a complex ecosystem that consists of the vines plus the soil and its natural surroundings and the living beings inhabiting those spaces.\nThat make it possible to achieve a balance that can develop resilience and adaptability and reduce external interventions."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.futurelearn.com\/info\/courses\/climate-smart-agriculture\/0\/steps\/26593","1":"www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/what-environmental-impact-grapes-thomas-fay-jr","2":"www.guadoalmelo.it\/en\/in-the-vineyard-grapes-and-the-environment\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

connective tissue health (3Trusted Source).\nNumerous studies have been performed on its benefits, showing that resveratrol protects against heart disease, lowers blood sugar and protects against the development of cancer (9Trusted Source).\nGrapes contain high levels of beneficial plant compounds, which may help protect against certain types of cancer (6Trusted Source).\nResveratrol, one of the compounds found in this fruit, has been well-studied in terms of cancer prevention and treatment.\nIt has been shown to protect against cancer by reducing inflammation, acting as an antioxidant and blocking the growth and spread of cancer cells within the body (10Trusted Source).\nIn addition to resveratrol, grapes also contain quercetin, anthocyanins and catechins \u2014 all of which may have beneficial effects against cancer (11Trusted Source).\nGrape extracts have been shown to block the growth and spread of human colon cancer cells in test-tube studies (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, one study in 30 people over the age of 50 showed that eating 1 pound (450 grams) of grapes per day for two weeks decreased markers of colon cancer risk (14Trusted Source).\nWhile studies on grapes and cancer in humans are limited, a diet high in antioxidant-rich foods, such as grapes, has been linked to a lower risk of cancer (18Trusted Source).\nLow intake of potassium has been linked to increased risks of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke (19).\nA study in 12,267 adults showed that people who consumed higher levels of potassium in relation to sodium were less likely to die from heart diseases than those who consumed less potassium (20Trusted Source).\nCompounds found in grapes may help protect against high cholesterol levels by decreasing cholesterol absorption (21Trusted Source).\nIn one study in 69 people with high cholesterol, eating three cups (500 grams) of red grapes a day for eight weeks was shown to lower total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\nAdditionally, diets high in resveratrol, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been shown to decrease cholesterol levels as well (23Trusted Source).\nIn a 16-week study in 38 men, those who took 20 grams of grape extract per day experienced decreased blood sugar levels, compared to a control group (24Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, resveratrol has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, which may improve your body\u2019s ability to use glucose and hence lower blood sugar levels (25Trusted Source).\nResveratrol also increases the number of glucose receptors on cell membranes, which may have a beneficial effect on blood sugar (26Trusted Source).\nIn one study, mice fed a diet supplemented with grapes showed fewer signs of damage to the retina and had better retinal function compared with mice who were not fed the fruit (27Trusted Source).\nIn a test-tube study, resveratrol was found to protect retinal cells in the human eye from ultraviolet A light.\nAccording to a review study, resveratrol may also help protect against glaucoma, cataract and diabetic eye disease (29Trusted Source).\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that these compounds help protect the eyes from damage from blue light (30Trusted Source).\nIn a 12- week study in 111 healthy older adults, 250 mg of a grape supplement per day significantly improved scores on a cognitive test measuring attention, memory and language compared to baseline values (31Trusted Source).\nStudies in rats have shown that resveratrol improved learning, memory and mood when taken for 4 weeks (33Trusted Source).\nResveratrol may also help protect against Alzheimer\u2019s disease, though studies in humans are needed to confirm this (34Trusted Source).\nGrape skin extract has been shown to protect against the flu virus in test-tube studies (42Trusted Source).\nIn a study in 24 men with metabolic syndrome \u2014 a risk factor for heart disease \u2014 a grape powder extract equivalent to approximately 1.5 cups (252 grams) of fresh grapes increased the number of anti-inflammatory compounds in their blood (52Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, another study in 75 people with heart disease found that taking grape powder extract increased levels of anti-inflammatory compounds, compared to a control group (53Trusted Source).\nA study in rats with inflammatory bowel disease showed that grape juice improved not only signs of the disease but also increased blood levels of anti-inflammatory compounds (54Trusted Source).\nHere are a few ways you can enjoy them: Grapes contain several important nutrients and powerful plant compounds that benefit your health.\nAntioxidants in grapes, such as resveratrol, reduce inflammation and may help protect against cancer,
