Hocking, in Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology (Second Edition), 2014 Rock melons (cantaloupes) may be affected by several diseases, the most important being stem-end rot due to A.\nTransgenic cantaloupe plants expressing hpRNAs to the capsid protein coding sequences of PRSV were resistant to infection by the virus in all four lines (Krubphachaya, Ju\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, & Kertbundit, 2007).\nTransgenic cucumber and melon expressing hpRNAs against HC-Pro encoding sequences of ZYMV showed complete resistance against ZYMV, while plants of one transgenic cucumber line that also showed enhanced expression of RDR1 and AGO1 exhibited very strong resistance to both WMV and PRSV (Leibman et al., 2011).\nD.R. Wagner, in Developments in Plant Genetics and Breeding, 2000 Practically all cultivated forms of cantaloupe belong to the highly polymorphic species Cucumis melo L.\nThe gene encoding SAMase has been introduced into the Cucumis melo genome using standard Agrobacterium binary vectors.\nWhen expressed, SAMase alters the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and causes a modified fruit ripening phenotype in cantaloupe.\nNon-transformed cantaloupe lines A and B are proprietary inbred lines developed by Harris Moran Seed Company, Inc, San Juan Bautista, California, USA.\nTransgenic line A was obtained through transformation of the parental inbred line A with a binary vector carrying the SAMase gene.\nSimilarly, transgenic line B is derived from a homozygous R1 progeny selected from an original R0 transformant B that was obtained by transformation of the parental inbred line B.\nThere are many examples of fruit-specific and ripening-associated promoters from plants.\nFor the expression of SAMase in cantaloupe, a novel ethylene responsive hybrid promoter was synthesized from elements of the tomato E8 and E4 promoters (Deikman et al., 1992; 1998; Xu et al., 1996; Clendennen et al., in press).\nThe resulting binary expression vector was used in the transformation of the A and B parental lines, independently.\nStable integration of the sam-k transgene into the cantaloupe genome results in the production of a functional SAMase protein.\nThe E8::E4:sam-k translational fusion present in lines A and B expresses SAMase in a fruit-specific and ethylene responsive manner, as determined by western blot analysis of total protein from different tissues of field-grown cantaloupe.\nTransgenic lines A and B initiate expression of the SAMase protein at varying levels in fruits that has begun to mature (full slip) and continue to express in fully mature (post slip) fruits.\nData collected from these trials, as well as from laboratory analyses demonstrate that SAMase-expressing cantaloupe lines A and B, except for the intended impact of SAMase expression on ethylene biosynthesis and related processes, do not differ from the non-transgenic parental varieties.\nSAMase melons show significant reductions (up to 60 %) in ethylene biosynthesis, both as inbreds homozygous for the introduced SAMase transgene and as hybrids generated with non-transgenic lines.\nSAMase melons also show minimal delay in the time from pollination to maturity, and initial results indicate that the fruit of the transgenic plants may be characterized as ripening more uniformly in the field.\nOther horticultural traits and yield are minimally impacted by SAMase expression, with the transgenic fruit most often showing no statistical differences from the non-transformed controls.\nIt was frequently observed that the concentration of soluble sugars was significantly higher in the transgenic fruit compared with the controls.\nchrysogenum NRRL 1951 from an infected cantaloupe in 1943, this microorganism has been subjected to classical mutagenesis along industrial strain improvement programs.\nThese strains are the parents of those overproducer mutants currently used for the industrial production of penicillin, which reaches titers of more than 50\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121 in fed-batch cultures.\nThe amplification of the genomic region that includes the three penicillin biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE, is one of the well-characterized modifications.\nThese genes are arranged in a single cluster located in a DNA region present as a single copy in the genome of the wild-type NRRL 1951 and Wisconsin 54-1255 strains (laboratory reference strain), but that is amplified in tandem repeats in penicillin-overproducing strains [16].\nIn addition to these genetic modifications, microbodies (peroxisomes) are also known to be more abundant in high-producing strains [17].\nThese organelles are involved in the final steps of the penicillin pathway, since activation of the side-chain precursor and its addition to the penam core take place in the peroxisomal matrix.\nTranscription of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acid precursors for penicillin biosynthesis, as well as of genes encoding microbody proteins, was higher in high-producing strains [17].\nIn addition, the increase in penicillin production along the industrial strain improvement program seemed to be also a consequence of complex metabolic reorganizations, pointing to oxidative stress responses as adaptation mechanisms for penicillin overproduction [24] (see Chapters.\nAs has been indicated so far, the rounds of classical mutagenesis introduced random modifications that led to the development of penicillin-overproducing strains.\nchrysogenum strains in order to introduce punctual modifications with a positive effect on the penicillin titers.\nMathers, in Molecular Basis of Nutrition and Aging, 2016 Vitamin C is found mainly in fruits and vegetables with the highest concentrations in cantaloupe, grapefruit, kiwi, mango, orange, tangerine, and strawberries.\nThe latter level of intake is associated with plasma concentrations of vitamin C of ~70\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L and with greater intakes circulating concentrations of vitamin C will reach, or exceed, the renal threshold of 80\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L and result in increasing urinary excretion [47].\nIn the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), about 10% of the included American population suffered from severe vitamin C deficiency (plasma concentration less than 11\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L) [47].\nAdditionally, 20% of males and 15% of females had marginal vitamin C deficiency (determined as plasma concentrations between 11 and 28\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L) [49].\nThe UK National Dietary Nutrition Survey showed that the mean plasma vitamin C concentration for men aged 19 to 64 years was 49.9\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L and for women aged 19 to 64 years 55.2\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L and both were above the level indicative of biochemical depletion.\nPrevalence of vitamin C deficiency (<11\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L) was approximately 10% in men and women aged 65 to 74 years but increased progressively with age (~16% in people 75 to 84 years and ~19% in those 85 years and over) and approached 40% in older people living in care homes.\nThe Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey (2003\u20132005) of a representative sample of the low-income\/materially deprived UK population estimated that 25% of men and 16% of women had deficient plasma vitamin C concentrations.\nThe authors concluded that the elderly would require double the oral intake of vitamin C, as compared with younger subjects, to maintain plasma concentration of 50\u00a0\u00b5mol\/L [51,52].\nChuck Palmer was one of 147 individuals across 28 states who experienced listeriosis as a result of eating cantaloupes contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.\nmonocytogenes in the field
