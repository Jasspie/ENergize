Division of Marine Fisheries statistics.\nThe need to investigate the causes of this decline is important not only to the economy of North Carolina, but also to the health of marine and estuarine ecosystems along the southeastern Atlantic coast.\nIn the lab run by Susanne Brander, an\u00a0ecotoxicologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, we are investigating the health of blue crabs from different estuaries along the North and South Carolina coasts, incorporating analysis of water and sediment chemistry in those areas.\nCompounds that enter waterways from agricultural, industrial and terrestrial uses are capable of exerting a wide range of negative influences on aquatic organisms.\nThe importance of such an investigation is not restricted merely to impacts on aquatic organisms such as the blue crab, but rather applies to ecosystem-wide health.\nMy research involves exposing larval and juvenile blue crabs to different concentrations of these two compounds over a period of time and then using genetic markers to evaluate differences in development.\nVery small concentrations of compounds entering waterways are capable of causing negative effects on a variety of aquatic invertebrates.\nTherefore, establishing a link between concentrations of insecticides in coastal waters and the health of blue crab populations could provide us with an early indicator of human health problems that may occur in the future."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.aquaticnuisance.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/2008 Ecological Impacts of the European Green Crab (Grosholz).pdf","1":"link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11160-014-9350-1","2":"ncseagrant.ncsu.edu\/currents\/2015\/01\/blue-crabs-and-environmental-pollutants\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":" 100","1":"ERROR","2":" 80"},"nutrition_titles":{"0":"Crab: Is It Good for You?
