\/ 77 gallons of water used to produce 1 pound of lemons, lemons have a relatively low water footprint Carbon footprint: low, 0.09 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of fresh lemons, a car driving equivalent of  0.25 miles or 0.5 kilometers, USA market data, lemons have a relatively low carbon footprintDestruction: low, lemon production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nWater with lemon is alkaline whereas lemonade is acidic due to the added sugar.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nLemons are a citrus fruit and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"Both ingredients, salmon and lemons, which I discussed in my last post, have the potential to develop negative effects to the environment.\nThe effects of fish farming salmon create local and global issues.\nLemons fall into the same category in that the environmental impacts range from local effects from fertilizers to global effects of pollution.\nBoth of these items have one major environmental impact in common and that is the pollution created from transporting these products across the world.\nThe pollution from shipping these items has a great effect on the environment at a global level.\nI mentioned a lot of local issues with farm-raised salmon in my last post.\nThe pens that salmon are kept in create a large range of environment issues from threats to other fish, mammals and birds that live near the pens, water contamination and the development and circulation of new diseases.\nIt would be in the best for the environment, to banish these fish farms and promote the population of wild salmon that live naturally.\nThe State of Washington Recreation and Conservation Office has a list of suggestions on how these changes assist in the effort to save wild salmon (I included the link in my last post.) The growth of lemon trees also can bare an impact on the local environment.\nThe biggest local environmental issue created by growing lemons is the use of fertilizers.","2":"We evaluated the sustainability of orange and lemon orchards, under organic and conventional farming, using an energy, environmental and economic analysis of the whole production cycle by using a life cycle assessment approach.\nThe results, based on unit surface area (ha) production, prove the stronger sustainability of the organic over the conventional system, both in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact, especially for lemons.\nIn terms of kg of final product, the organic production system showed better environmental and energy performances."},"environment_urls":{"0":"healabel.com\/l-ingredients\/lemons","1":"emilyquinblog.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/10\/environmental-effects-of-lemons-and-farmed-salmon-local-and-global\/","2":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23850762\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Preparation Information, and More"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"A great source of vitamin C and fiber, lemons contain many plant compounds, minerals, and essential oils.\nEating lemons may lower your risk of heart disease, cancer, and kidney stones.\nThe plant compounds in lemons and other citrus fruit may have beneficial effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nMany of the plant compounds in lemons are not found in high amounts in lemon juice, so it is recommended to eat the whole fruit \u2014 excluding the peel \u2014 for maximum benefit (16, 17Trusted Source).\nLemons contain plant compounds that provide various health benefits.\nCitrus fruits, including lemons, are associated with numerous health benefits.\nIntake of fruits high in vitamin C is linked to reduced heart disease risk (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nIntake of isolated fibers from citrus fruits has been shown to decrease blood cholesterol levels, and the essential oils in lemons can protect LDL (bad) cholesterol particles from becoming oxidized (23, 24).\nRecent studies in rats show that the plant compounds hesperidin and diosmin may have beneficial effects on some key risk factors for heart disease (25, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nThe citric acid in lemons may reduce your risk of kidney stones (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nLemons contain small amounts of iron, but they are a great source of vitamin C and citric acid, which can increase the absorption of iron from other foods (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nLemons may help protect against anemia, prevent the formation of kidney stones, and reduce your risk of heart disease and cancer.\nDrinking water with freshly squeezed lemon may have some health benefits.\nLemon water is a rich source of vitamin C and plant compounds, which can enhance immune function, protect against various diseases, and increase your absorption of iron (5Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nThe citric acid in lemons decreases your risk of kidney stones by diluting urine and increasing its citrate content (28Trusted Source).\nDrinking lemon water may decrease stress, enhance immune function, help prevent anemia, reduce your risk of kidney stones, and protect against several diseases.\nLemons are generally well tolerated, but citrus fruit may cause allergic reactions in a small number of people (44Trusted Source).\nLemons are quite acidic, so eating them frequently may be harmful to dental health if your tooth enamel becomes damaged (46Trusted Source).\nThey are an excellent source of vitamin C, soluble fibers, and plant compounds \u2014 all of which can provide health benefits.\nThe lemon is a very healthy fruit that is loaded with vitamin C and fiber.\nMany people are turning to \"master cleanses,\" such as the lemon water detox, to improve their health.","1":"Lemons are high in vitamin C, fiber, and various beneficial plant compounds.\nResearch shows that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\nThe fiber and plant compounds in lemons could also significantly lower some risk factors for heart disease (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nPlant compounds found in lemons \u2014 namely hesperidin and diosmin \u2014 have also been found to lower cholesterol (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9).\nAnother theory suggests that drinking hot water with lemon will help you lose weight.\nHowever, drinking water is known to temporarily increase the number of calories you burn, so it may be the water itself that is helping with weight loss \u2014 not the lemon (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nOther theories suggest that the plant compounds in lemons may aid weight loss.\nResearch shows that plant compounds in lemon extracts may help prevent or reduce weight gain in a number of ways (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nHowever, no studies confirm the weight loss effects of lemon compounds in humans.\nJust a 1\/2-cup (4 ounces or 125 ml) of lemon juice per day may provide enough citric acid to help prevent stone formation in people who have already had them (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nTherefore, more well-conducted studies need to examine whether lemon juice affects kidney stone formation (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nLemons contain some iron, but they primarily prevent anemia by improving your absorption of iron from plant foods (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nBecause lemons contain both vitamin C and citric acid, they may protect against anemia by ensuring that you absorb as much iron as possible from your diet.\nSome researchers think that plant compounds found in lemons \u2014 such as limonene and naringenin \u2014 could have anticancer effects, but this hypothesis needs further investigation (5Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).\nAnimal studies indicate that D-limonene, a compound found in lemon oil, does have anticancer properties (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nAnother study used pulp from mandarins that contained the plant compounds beta-cryptoxanthin and hesperidin, which are also found in lemons.\nHowever, to get the benefits of fiber from lemons, you need to eat the pulp.\nPeople who drink lemon juice, without the fiber found in the pulp, will miss out on the benefits of the fiber.\nLemons contain a high amount of vitamin C, soluble fiber, and plant compounds that give them a number of health benefits.\nLemons may aid weight loss and reduce your risk of heart disease, anemia, kidney stones, digestive issues, and cancer.\nThis article investigates the evidence\u2026 Despite its acidic pH, some people say lemon juice has alkalizing effects in the body.","2":"This bright yellow citrus fruit possesses a distinctive sour taste due to its richness in citric acid.\nThe vitamins, fiber, and plant compounds in lemons can provide essential health benefits.\nLemon also contains a high level of dietary fiber, which can reduce risk factors for heart disease by lowering LDL or bad cholesterol.\nLemon contains high amounts of dietary fiber.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that drinking water may keep you full and help you avoid snacking as effectively as lemon.\nWhile lemon doesn\u2019t contain extremely high iron levels, it can help your body absorb more iron from plant-based foods in your diet.\nLemons get their sour taste from their abundance of citric acid.\nLemon is a flavorful and healthy addition to most recipes, but, like all fruits, it contains natural sugar.\nWith their distinct sour taste, lemons add a bold flavor to many recipes.\nLemon is a popular ingredient in cooking and baking, and you can use almost every part of this versatile fruit."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/lemons","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/6-lemon-health-benefits","2":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-lemon"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
