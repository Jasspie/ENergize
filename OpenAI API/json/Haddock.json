used in traditional British fish suppers, other white fish like plaice, coley, pollock, and skate are often used.","1":"In the western North Atlantic, they\u2019re found from Newfoundland to Cape May, New Jersey, and are most abundant on Georges Bank and in the Gulf of Maine.\nAbove target population levels.\nThere are two stocks of haddock: Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine stocks.\nThe Gulf of Maine stock is not overfished and is not subject to overfishing (2019 stock assessment).\nHaddock is managed under the Northeast Multispecies (Groundfish) Fishery Management Plan\u00a0along with 12 other species of groundfish.","2":"The haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a saltwater ray-finned fish from the family Gadidae, the true cods.\nIt is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and associated seas where it is an important species for fisheries, especially in northern Europe where it is marketed fresh, frozen and smoked; smoked varieties include the Finnan haddie and the Arbroath smokie.\nThe haddock has the elongated, tapering body shape typical of members of the cod family.[2] It has a relatively small mouth which does not extend to below the eye; with the lower profile of the face being straight and the upper profile slightly rounded, this gives its snout a characteristic wedge-shaped profile.\nThere are also two anal fins and in these there are 21 to 25 fin rays in the first and 20 to 24 fin rays in the second.[3] The anal and dorsal fins are all separated from each other.[6] The pelvic fins are small with an elongated first fin ray.[7] The upper side of the haddock's body varies in colour from dark grey brown to nearly black while the lower part of the body is dull silvery white.\nIt also occurs around Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea in the Arctic.[6] The largest stocks are in the North Sea, off the Faroe Islands, off Iceland and the coast of Norway but these are discrete populations with little interchange between them.\nOff North America, the haddock is found from western Greenland south to Cape Hatteras, but the main commercially fished stock occurs from Cape Cod and the Grand Banks.[9] The haddock is a demersal species which occurs at depths from 10 to 450\u00a0m (33 to 1,500\u00a0ft; 5.5 to 250 fathoms), although it is most frequently recorded at 80 to 200\u00a0m (300 to 700\u00a0ft; 40 to 100 fathoms).\nOff Iceland and in the Barents Sea, haddock undergo extensive migrations, but in the north western Atlantic its movements are more restricted, consisting of movements to and from their spawning areas.\nTheir lifespan is around 14 years.[6] The most important spawning grounds are in the waters off the central coast of Norway, off the southwest of Iceland, and over the Georges Bank.[10][11] The fish which spawn in inshore waters are normally smaller and younger fish than those which occur in offshore areas.\nOnce hatched the larvae do not appear to travel far from their spawning grounds, however some larvae spawning off the west coast of Scotland are transported into the North Sea through the Fair Isle-Shetland Gap or to the northeast of Shetland.[12] In their larval stages, haddock mainly feed on the immature stages of copepods and the pelagic post-larvae up to 3\u201310\u00a0cm (1\u20134\u00a0in) in length prey on krill, Larvaceans, decapod larvae, copepods and on small fish.\nAdults prey on fish such as sand eels, Trisopterus esmarkii, Hippoglossoides platessoides, gobies, European sprat, and Atlantic herring, as well as capelin, silver hake, American eels and argentines.[4] When a number of fish taken at the same time have their stomach contents sampled, the majority of stomachs contain similar prey, this suggests that haddocks feed in shoals.[10] Shellfish, sea urchins, brittlestars and worms are also important prey,[9] especially in the winter.[12] Juvenile haddock are an important prey for larger demersal fish, including other gadoids, while seals prey on the larger fish.[10] The recorded growth rates of haddock underwent significant change over the 30 to 40 years up to 2011.[10] Growth has been more rapid in recent years, with haddock attaining adult size much earlier than was noted 30\u201340 years ago.\nThere is some evidence which indicates that these slower growth rates may be the result of an exceptionally large year class in 2003.[11] The haddock stock periodically has higher than normal productivity; for example in 1962 and 1967, and to a lesser extent, 1974 and 1999.\nThe specific name is a latinisation of the vernacular names \u201cEgrefin\u201d and \u201cEglefin\u201d, used in France and England.[17] Haddock is fished year-round using gear such as Danish seine nets, trawlers, long lines and gill nets and is often caught in mixed species fishery with other groundfish species such as cod and whiting.\nThe main fishing grounds in the eastern Atlantic are in the Barents Sea, around Iceland, around the Faeroe Islands, in the North Sea, Celtic Sea, and in the English Channel.\nThe haddock populations in the western Atlantic (offshore grounds of Georges Bank off New England and Nova Scotia) are also considered to be harvested sustainably.[28] Haddock is very popular as a food fish.\nTraditional Grimsby smoked fish (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smokehouses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations.[36] Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.\nThese fishing grounds are sustainably managed[37] and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.[38] One popular form of haddock is Finnan haddie which is named after the fishing village of Finnan or Findon in Scotland, where the fish was originally cold-smoked over smouldering peat."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.msc.org\/what-you-can-do\/eat-sustainable-seafood\/fish-to-eat\/haddock","1":"www.fisheries.noaa.gov\/species\/haddock","2":"en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haddock"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

high-protein, low-calorie and low-mercury content, but it ranks lower than many other fish for its heart-healthy fats.\nThe health benefits of haddock include: very low in calories (77 calories per 3 ounces), high in protein (17 grams per 3 ounces) and an excellent source of selenium, phosphorus and some of the B vitamins.\nThe American Heart Association recommends 3 ounces as the serving size for cooked fish.\nA similar serving of smoked haddock contains slightly more, with 99 calories.\nBy comparison, a serving of a fatty fish like cooked sockeye salmon comes in at 133 calories.\nA serving of cooked haddock supplies 17 grams of protein, or 34 percent of the daily value if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet.\nLike other fish, cooked and smoked salmon supply only a trace of saturated fat, making them a heart-healthy choice for your meals and a good substitute for red meat.\nBoth types of haddock contain dietary cholesterol, with cooked haddock giving you 19 percent of the daily value and smoked haddock, 22 percent.\nSalmon Protein The fat in fish comes primarily from polyunsaturated fats called omega-3 fatty acids.\nAll fin fish and shellfish contain some omega-3s, but fattier fish like salmon, herring and mackerel supply the richest amounts of it \u2014 over 1,500 milligrams in a serving.\nWhile haddock does supply omega-3s, it falls at the lower end of the scale for these beneficial fats, providing less than 200 milligrams in a 3-ounce cooked serving.\nWhile there's no daily value for omega-3 fatty acids, the adequate intake \u2014 the amount needed for satisfactory nutrition \u2014 is 1,100 milligrams a day for women and 1,600 milligrams for men of combined DHA and EPA, or eicosapentaenoic acid.\nA serving of cooked haddock supplies a mix of minerals, most in small amounts.\nIn 3 ounces of cooked haddock, you'll get 19 percent of the daily value for phosphorus and 49 percent for selenium.\nA serving provides 17 percent of the daily value for phosphorus, and 66 percent of your selenium needs.\nSmoking, however, also increases haddock's content of the mineral sodium, because the process involves salting the fish.\nWhile cooked haddock contains only 222 milligrams of sodium, smoked haddock provides three times that amount.\nChoose regular cooked haddock more often than smoked to avoid excess sodium intake.\nIn addition to metabolizing protein and carbs, vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, helps form red blood cells and supports brain health.\nYou'll get 22 percent of the daily value for niacin in a serving of cooked haddock, and 27 percent in smoked haddock.\nA serving of cooked haddock supplies 16 percent of your needs for vitamin B6 and 75 percent of the daily value for B12.\nThree ounces of smoked haddock gives you 20 percent of the daily value for B6 and 57 percent of B12.\nIn addition to the health benefits of haddock, this mild fish tastes delicious and lends itself to a variety of cooking methods and dishes.\nBrits use haddock for their tasty fish and chips, but the traditional dish is loaded with fat and calories.\nLike cod, haddock works well in fish chowder or stew.","2":"Haddock,\u00a0scientifically known
