emissions for common protein foods and vegetables, expressed as kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per kg of consumed product.\nMethane (CH4) \u2013 a greenhouse gas 25 times more (CH4) potent than carbon dioxide (CO2), accounts for nearly half the emissions generated in this study\u2019s Nebraska beef production model (see chart below).\nPound for pound, ruminants also require significantly more energy-intensive feed and generate more manure than pork or chicken (see figure 2).\nFertilizer applied to soil generates nitrous oxide (N20), which has 300 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide.\nFertilizer and pesticide production requires a significant amount of energy, but our model found that together they account for just 12 percent of the emissions from growing feed.\nManure: Animal waste releases nitrous oxide and methane and pollutes our water and air, especially when it is concentrated.\nIn 2007, U.S. livestock in confined feeding operations generated about 500 million tons of manure a year, three times the amount of human waste produced by the entire U.S. population (EPA 2007).\nIn the case of beef and dairy, this is due to the high methane (CH4) emissions from the ruminants\u2019 digestion and manure, as well as the nitrous oxide generated from growing feed.\nIn the case of farmed salmon, the primary emissions in the production phase come from feed.","1":"Proceed to www.earthtimes.org (unsafe)","2":"Nowadays, eating lamb, beef, pork, chicken, seafood and processed meat is a daily occurrence for the average family.\nBut these farming practices are not sustainable and there is a significant environmental impact of eating\u00a0meat.\nAt some point, we\u2019re going to have to address the problems caused by the mass production of animal products and the toll it\u2019s taking on our\u00a0environment.\nRaising this number of animals takes vast amounts of land and water at a time when both of these commodities are becoming\u00a0scarce.\nAnimal waste releases harmful gases such as methane which pollute our air, water and soil.\nAnd it\u2019s thought that the farming of livestock is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gases.\nIf you want to change your meat eating habits, so you\u2019re consuming the most environmentally friendly meat, you need to understand the impact of different\u00a0meats.\nLet\u2019s take a look at each meat in turn, starting with lamb, the least sustainable meat.\nBased on figures from the Meat Eaters Guide to Climate Change and Health report, lamb has the highest carbon\u00a0footprint.\nEven before beginning its journey to our supermarkets, lamb produces an average of 20.44 kg of C02 emissions per kg of\u00a0product.\nCattle farming uses billions of gallons of water and, like sheep, cows produce methane as a\u00a0by-product.\nAgain, food miles need to be considered and the environmental impact will depend whether the beef is grown in the UK or\u00a0imported.\nIt\u2019s carbon footprint rises as the meat is transported and turned into processed\u00a0meat.\nThese birds do not produce methane and need less food and water than sheep and cows.\nIf you want to minimise your carbon footprint without giving up meat, chicken is your best\u00a0option.\nChicken produces 2.33 kg of C02 per kg of meat before transport and\u00a0processing.\nOnly time will tell but at the moment it\u2019s worth considering wild game as an alternative\u00a0meat.\nAll too often the question of environmental friendliness becomes synonymous with emissions \u2013 greenhouse gases and carbon emissions \u2013 and focuses on discussions pertaining to climate change.\nTo truly assess how environmentally friendly meat is we also need to factor in the impact on land, water and biodiversity.\nThe way animals are farmed, and the impact those methods have on the environment, is just as important as the carbon footprint of the meat\u00a0itself.\nOrganic farming is an agricultural system that focuses on sustainability and biodiversity, and is designed to concentrate on using natural resources and prohibits the use of synthetic\u00a0substances.\nWhile not exclusively applied to animal husbandry, organic farms attempt to raise organic livestock and poultry in natural living conditions using natural, organic feed.\nUnder the strict organic regulations it\u2019s widely accepted that organic farming provides environmental benefits but there are concerns as to whether animal welfare is any better than in traditional\u00a0farming.\nMuch of the developed world relies on intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production to cater for the increasing demand for meat.\nIntensive farming is also cited as contributing to global issues such as decreased public health, land degradation and deforestation, increased pollution and poor water\u00a0management.\nHistorically this intensive method of animal agriculture has been agreed as the most efficient solution for meeting the global demand for meat.\nWhere industrial farming put animals and the environment at the bottom of the list of priorities, regenerative agriculture does the exact opposite.\nAs the name suggests, regenerative agriculture focuses on regenerating soil, biodiversity, water systems and carbon sequestration by taking a conservation and rehabilitation approach to\u00a0farming.\nIt\u2019s all well and good knowing that there are a series of different farming methods, but tracking down how your chosen meat was farmed is an entirely different matter.\nTransparency is still lacking across our food systems, so if you want to know where your meat has come from and how it was farmed you\u2019ll need to do some\u00a0digging.\nWhichever meat you choose to consume there will be some negative\u00a0environmental impact of eating\u00a0meat.\nIt can be difficult to find sustainable meat in the UK, especially if you\u2019re looking in the supermarket.\nIf you aren\u2019t willing to give up meat, then it\u2019s best to opt for the most sustainable meat you can find that fits your budget.\nThat might mean that you have to eat less meat, but that\u2019s probably a good thing\u00a0anyway.\nAre you looking to eat less meat but don't know where to start?"},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.ewg.org\/meateatersguide\/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters\/climate-and-environmental-impacts\/","1":"www.earthtimes.org\/going-green\/eating-lamb-worst-environment\/1161\/","2":"www.ecoandbeyond.co\/articles\/most-environmentally-friendly-meat\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Nutrition Facts and Recipes - Dr. Axe"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Additionally, we will examine the science-backed health benefits of lamb to show why it is one of the healthiest foods around.\nLamb is a kind of red meat because it has a high myoglobin content, an iron-rich protein found in the muscle of animals.\nMyoglobin contains heme, which is a pigment that gives meat its red color (1).\nLamb is a nutrient-dense food, and it is rich in protein, vitamins and essential minerals.\nBefore we get started looking at the health benefits, many people wonder how lamb compares to mutton nutritionally.\nAs sheep eat large quantities of grass throughout their life, mutton meat becomes very fatty and imparts a much stronger flavor.\nHowever, some people have a taste preference for the higher fat content and stronger flavor.\nThe nutritional value of lamb is impressive; it contains a range of beneficial nutrients including protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.\nCompared to most meat, lamb also has a much higher omega-3 content.\nL-Carnosine is a compound that contains two amino acids (proteins) bonded together; beta-alanine and histidine.\nOnly certain foods contain carnosine in high amounts, and lamb is one of these.\nPer 100 grams, lamb contains \u2013 on average \u2013 400mg of carnosine, which is slightly higher than beef (365mg) (6).\nHowever, recent research is showing that higher amounts of carnosine from external sources may offer additional health benefits.\nLamb is extremely rich in protein, and depending on the cut it contains anywhere between 25 \u2013 30 grams per 100 grams (11, 12, 13).\nIn other words; the efficiency by which our body can use protein differs depending on the specific food and the amino acids it contains.\nOn the positive side, lamb contains every amino acid, and we can, therefore, class it as a \u2018complete\u2019 protein.\nProtein is incredibly important for our health, and it encourages lean muscle mass, the growth and repair of cells, and higher levels of satiety (14, 15, 16).\nWhile some people like to judge food based on how many calories it contains, the caloric load says little about the food\u2019s relative health merits.\nAs one such animal, lamb tends to be an excellent source of omega-3.\nIn pasture-raised lamb, the levels of omega-3 are higher than grain-finished animals.\nMany different foods contain iron and it is present in everything from spinach and kale to bananas and tomatoes.\nImportantly, lamb contains a rich source of heme iron in amounts similar to other red meat such as beef.\nRed meat is the most substantial dietary source of creatine and lamb contains approximately 300-500 mg per 100 grams (24).\nAlthough this is not close to the same level as creatine supplement dosages (3 \u2013 5 grams per day), it should still have a physiological benefit \u2013 especially for those eating higher amounts of lamb and beef.\nOn this note, a further health benefit of lamb is that it contains glutathione (28).\nAlso, it contains all three amino acids that our body requires to synthesize glutathione internally.\nLamb contains a source of the natural trans-fatty acid CLA.\nFirstly, don\u2019t worry about the name \u2018trans fat\u2019 because the naturally occurring version found in animal foods is much different from synthetic trans-fat (29).\nTo illustrate this point, the people with higher levels of CLA were likely consuming more meat and dairy (and probably less refined carbohydrate).\nEither way, lamb meat is richer in CLA than any other meat and contains approximately 4 \u2013 19.0 mg CLA per gram of fat content.\nSome people still worry about the cholesterol content of animal products due to the decades of warnings against dietary cholesterol.\nLamb is a very nutritious food that is full of protein, healthy fats and a wide range of micronutrients.\nAll in all, lamb is possibly the best choice of meat for those looking for the most health benefits.","1":"Being rich in high-quality protein and many vitamins and minerals, lamb can be an excellent component of a healthy diet.\nLamb is mainly composed of protein but also contains varying amounts of fat.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of roasted lamb provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Like other types of meat, lamb is primarily composed of protein.\nThe protein content of lean, cooked lamb is usually 25\u201326% (1Trusted Source).\nLamb meat is a high-quality protein source, providing all nine essential amino acids your body needs for growth and maintenance.\nThus, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of roasted lamb provides 6.9 grams of saturated, 7 grams of monounsaturated, and only 1.2 grams of polyunsaturated fat (1Trusted Source).\nSaturated fat has long been considered a risk factor for heart disease, but many studies have not found any link (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nCompared to other ruminant meats \u2014 such as beef and veal \u2014 lamb contains the highest amounts of CLA (9Trusted Source).\nCLA has been linked to various health benefits, including reduced body fat mass, but large amounts in supplements may have adverse effects on metabolic health (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).\nLamb is a rich source of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.\nAs a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and high-quality proteins, lamb can be an excellent component of a healthy diet.\nMeat is one of the best dietary sources of high-quality protein.\nThis increases your risk of sarcopenia, an adverse condition associated with very low muscle mass (26Trusted Source).\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle and adequate exercise, regular consumption of lamb \u2014 or other high-protein foods \u2014 may help preserve muscle mass.\nBeta-alanine is found in high amounts in meat, such as lamb, beef, and pork.\nDiets low in beta-alanine \u2014 such as vegetarian and vegan diets \u2014 may decrease levels of carnosine in your muscles over time (33Trusted Source).\nAs a rich source of highly available iron, lamb may help prevent anemia.\nObservational studies have revealed mixed results on the link between red meat and heart disease.\nSome studies find an increased risk from eating high amounts of both processed and unprocessed meat, whereas others note an increased risk for processed meat only \u2014 or no effect at all (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\nMany people believe that meat causes heart disease because it contains high amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat \u2014 impairing the blood lipid profile.\nHowever, most scientists now agree that dietary cholesterol is not a risk factor for heart disease (25Trusted Source).\nMany studies have not been able to link saturated fat with an increased risk of heart disease (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nLean lamb has been shown to have similar effects as fish or white meat, such as chicken (47Trusted Source).\nStill, you should avoid eating high amounts of cured lamb or meat cooked at high heat.\nIt\u2019s debated whether eating lamb increases your risk of heart disease.\nA number of observational studies show that people who eat a lot of red meat are at an increased risk of colon cancer over time (48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source).\nSeveral substances in red meat may increase cancer risk, including heterocyclic amines (53Trusted Source).\nStudies consistently indicate that eating overcooked meat \u2014 or other dietary sources of heterocyclic amines \u2014 may increase the risk of various cancers, including of the colon, breast, and prostate (56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source).\nThough there is no clear-cut proof that meat intake causes cancer, it seems sensible to avoid eating high amounts of overcooked meat.\nEating a lot of red meat has been linked to increased cancer risk.\nNot only is it a rich source of high-quality protein, but it is also an outstanding source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12.\nOn the negative side, some observational studies have linked a high intake of red meat to an increased risk of cancer and heart disease.\nLamb contains saturated fats, which can increase cholesterol levels, but there are ways to limit your exposure.\nEating processed meat is linked to increased risk of several diseases, including cancer.","2":"Maybe you have never given lamb a try or maybe you already love it, but either way, you may be wondering\u00a0if lamb is a healthy meat choice.\nIn moderation, lamb is an excellent source of protein and vital nutrients like iron, zinc, selenium and vitamin B12.\nYes, lamb is a type of red meat and you probably know that red meat often gets a bad rep, but high-quality red meats like grass-fed beef and grass-fed lamb are excellent and truly healthy protein sources in moderation.\nI\u2019m about to answer a lot of common questions about lambs, including what is a lamb, the difference between lamb and sheep, how lamb can boost your health, and also some of the tastiest and healthiest lamb recipes around.\nRed meats have a high myoglobin content, which is a protein found in muscle that changes to red when it\u2019s mixed with\u00a0oxygen.\nOne ounce of regular lamb (not grass-fed) has the same number of calories as grass-fed beef but actually has more health-promoting omega 3 fatty acids.\nA\u00a0baby lamb is a sheep that\u2019s under one year old, and the meat that comes from a sheep at this young age is called lamb.\nSo mutton is the meat of a sheep that\u2019s over the age of one.\nFor example, just three ounces of lamb contains approximately the following: (3) As a red meat, lamb inherently has a lot more iron than other protein sources like chicken or fish.\nHeme iron is\u00a0the more absorbable form of iron so consuming red meat like lamb can help to improve and prevent iron deficiency and anemia symptoms.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, the bioavailability of iron is approximately 14 percent to 18 percent when someone consumes a diet that includes significant quantities of meat, seafood as well as vitamin C, which boosts iron absorption.\n(5) Other studies, like one published\u00a0by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2000, indicate\u00a0that this number might be even higher, with up to 39 percent of the population possibly suffering from a vitamin B12 deficiency.\n(6) Lamb is an awesome source of B12 with just three ounces of lamb meat providing just under half of most people\u2019s daily B12 requirements.\n(7) In case you\u2019re not entirely sure why the nervous system is so important, this system is essentially the body\u2019s electrical wiring that\u2019s responsible for helping the entire body properly communicate and function.\nThis nutrient can be found in cells throughout our bodies, and it\u2019s absolutely essential to optimal immune health, along with\u00a0wound healing, DNA and protein synthesis, as well as growth and development in children.\n(8) Consuming lamb meat and other zinc-rich foods can help keep your zinc levels in a healthy place and boost your overall immune function.\nIn addition, zinc helps enable optimal senses of taste and smell (two very important things when you\u2019re consuming some tasty lamb meat).\nMany people are aware of the many benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, but not too many realize that lamb meat is a noteworthy source of these healthy fatty acids.\nGrass-fed lamb meat also\u00a0provides its consumers with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).\nFor starters, CLA has been shown to help aid fat loss, improve lean muscle mass and animal studies have even shown it may be a potential cancer fighter (especially breast cancer) in humans.\nThe protein found in lamb meat is made of essential amino acids, which can only be obtained through our diets.\nAnimal protein sources like lamb meat\u00a0are considered \u201ccomplete proteins\u201d\u00a0because they contain all essential amino acids.\nOther non-meat protein sources, like vegetables, grains and nuts, typically do not contain at least one or more essential amino acids.\nMany health stores carry lamb meat too, and much of the time it\u2019s local lamb meat.\nIt\u2019s also best to buy organic and grass-fed to get the highest-quality lamb meat possible.\nJust like grass-fed beef has a bumped-up array of nutrients and health benefits, so does grass-fed lamb meat.\n(14) A Garlic Lamb Roast Recipe and other rack of lamb recipes are very popular, especially around holidays like Easter and Passover, or for other large gatherings.\nIn case you\u2019re at a loss for\u00a0a delicious lamb recipe, here are some of my favorite ways to consume lamb.\nThese lamb recipes are loaded with flavor as well as nutrients: Lamb has been considered a\u00a0religious symbol, specifically a symbol of sacrifice, since ancient times.\nIf you experience a stuffy nose, a runny nose, feel nauseous or suddenly have a rash after consuming lamb, then it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re allergic to lamb.\n(16) Lamb, like other red meat, does contain a significant amount of cholesterol so it should be enjoyed in moderation, especially if you have high cholesterol.\nTrimming lamb fat can help keep the cholesterol levels of lamb meat down.\nIn moderation, high-quality (organic and grass-fed) lamb meat is an awesome, healthy protein source that offers a wide range of concentrated and health-boosting nutrients.\nFor instance, lamb\u00a0is an excellent iron source, nervous system health promoter, immune booster, rich source of healthy fats and protein powerhouse.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family
