forward to roughly 2,000 years ago, history shows the Romans in England enjoying this salty seafood.\nRaw oysters are also an abundant source of several vitamins and minerals.\nThey\u2019re a particularly good source of vitamin B12, which research has indicated plays a big role in keeping your brain healthy.\nOther micronutrients include: Oysters are low-calorie and high in micronutrients, making them a healthy food for many people.\nA deficiency in vitamin B12 has been associated with dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nVitamin B12 deficiency has also been linked to mental health symptoms including depressed and suicidal thoughts.\nWhen consumed at too high a level, selenium is toxic, however, a deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular disease, infertility, and cognitive decline.\nThose most at risk for serious complications from bacterial contamination are people with cancer, diabetes, and liver disease.\nAnyone, including those without these diseases, should seek medical attention immediately if they develop symptoms of food poisoning after eating raw oysters.\nClinical cases in Mineral and Bone Metabolism: \u201cCopper, magnesium, zinc and calcium

various\u00a0health benefits, and they are particularly good for their vitamin B12, omega-3, and mineral content.\nIn this next section, we will look at some of the numerous benefits that oyster intake can provide.\nAlthough not commonly referred to when discussing the benefits of omega-3, oysters offer a good source.\nPer 100 grams, oysters provide around 672 mg of omega-3 fatty acids (1).\nOne hundred grams of oysters only offer seven grams of protein, but it is the per-calorie protein ratio that is particularly impressive.\nOn this note, oysters offer this seven grams of protein for only 68 calories, which rivals lean red meat for protein density (1).\nOysters offer a surprising amount of zinc, and they are the world\u2019s best dietary source of the mineral.\nOne hundred grams of oysters provide an impressive 491% of the reference daily intake (RDI) for zinc.\nFor instance, we can get 320 IU of vitamin D from 100 grams of oysters, which represents approximately 80% of the RDI (1).\nTherefore, oysters are a great potential source of the vitamin for people who don\u2019t get enough sun exposure, or for individuals living in countries with long and dark winters.\nHowever, oysters offer far more of this nutrient than any typical meat, and only organ meats like liver can rival their B12 content.\nThe table below shows how oysters compare to meat and organ meats for vitamin B12 content, per 100 grams raw (1, 10, 11, 12).\nWhile oysters don\u2019t offer as much B12 as liver, they are among the very best dietary sources of the vitamin.\nOysters are rich in copper, and they contain 4.5 mg of the mineral per 100 grams, which works out at 223% of the RDI (1).\nOnce again, except for organ meats, oysters are the top dietary source of copper.\nFirstly, oysters are very high in zinc, which appears to play an essential role in cellular structure and maintaining optimal cardiovascular function (14, 15).\nOmega-3, also contained in oysters, may help to lower several risk factors for cardiovascular disease by decreasing triglycerides and improving HDL levels (17).\nSince oysters contain almost 500% of the RDI for zinc per 100 grams, they will certainly boost zinc status in individuals with low levels.\nOne hundred grams provides many multiples of the RDI for numerous essential vitamins and minerals.\nIn addition to Vibriosis, raw oysters can be a risk factor for certain other types of foodborne illnesses.\nThe tables below show the complete nutrition profile for oysters per 100 grams raw (1).\nOysters offer an outstanding nutrition profile which is only really rivaled by organ meats.\nWith such a large amount of B12, vitamin D, selenium, copper and zinc, including oysters in our diet can offer numerous benefits.","2":"This article reviews the impressive health benefits \u2014 but also risks \u2014 of eating oysters and explains the best ways to prepare them.\nIn fact, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of wild eastern oysters provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Oysters are low in calories yet loaded with nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.\nPeople who eat diets high in omega-3 fats have a lower risk of developing conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nOysters are packed with essential nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.\nThey\u2019re especially high in the following vitamins and minerals: Aside from their other various roles in health, many of these nutrients offer antioxidant protection as well.\nWhat\u2019s more, zinc and vitamins B12 and D also have antioxidant effects, boosting the protective benefits of oysters even higher (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that people who eat diets rich in antioxidants lower their risk of heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nFor example, a review of nine studies demonstrated that high-protein diets significantly reduced levels of hemoglobin A1c \u2014 a marker of long-term blood sugar control \u2014 in adults with type 2 diabetes (21Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, high-protein diets may reduce heart disease risk factors in those with type 2 diabetes.\nA review of 18 studies in people with type 2 diabetes found that high-protein diets significantly reduced triglyceride levels \u2014 a major risk factor for heart disease (22Trusted Source).\nHigh-protein diets that include oysters may promote weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and reduce heart disease risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.\nAside from being packed with beneficial nutrients like vitamins, oysters also contain a recently discovered, unique antioxidant called 3,5-Dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA).\nIn fact, a test-tube study showed that it was 15 times more powerful in fighting oxidative stress than Trolox, a synthetic form of vitamin E commonly used to prevent damage caused by oxidative stress (23Trusted Source).\nSome test-tube studies indicate that DHMBA from oysters may be of particular benefit to liver health.\nFor example, one test-tube study demonstrated that it protected human liver cells from damage and cell death caused by induced oxidative stress (24Trusted Source).\nScientists are hopeful that DHMBA may be useful in preventing or treating liver diseases in the future, but research is limited to test-tube studies at this time (25Trusted Source).\nThough it\u2019s clear that oysters offer impressive health benefits, some potential concerns exist \u2014 especially when consuming them raw.\nEating raw oyster meat poses a greater risk of bacterial infection.\nOysters can also carry Norwalk-type viruses and enteroviruses that can pose health risks (30Trusted Source).\nDue to these potential health risks, children, those with compromised immune systems, and pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid eating raw seafood (32Trusted Source, 33, 34).\nBecause they can pose a health risk, eat raw oysters with caution.\nThey\u2019re packed with high-quality protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants \u2014 all of which benefit health.\nStill, raw oysters can contain potentially harmful bacteria, so enjoy them cooked to avoid infection.\nThis article reviews different types of shellfish, their\u2026 Vitamin D is essential for health, but it can be hard to get enough of it from your diet."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/oysters-good-for-you","1":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/oysters-nutrition-benefits\/","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/oysters"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
