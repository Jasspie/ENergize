A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.\nQ. I keep a bag of nuts and dried fruit in my desk at work.\nPeanuts are much cheaper than tree nuts, but the amount of saturated fat gives me pause.\nI don\u2019t know anything about the impacts of growing some of the more exotic nuts, like Brazil nuts, cashews, and hazelnuts.\nA. Dearest Adrian, Grist thanks its sponsors.\nCrunchy, healthy nuts plus chewy, healthy dried fruit plus \u2026 oh, I believe you\u2019ve forgotten the most important ingredient in any trail mix: chocolate, of course!\nWe\u2019ve dealt quite a bit with almonds and their water requirements here at Grist, and walnuts and pistachios raise the same issues, so for now let\u2019s skip those.\nI\u2019m not going to tell you to stop eating them altogether \u2013 it\u2019s complicated, like most food issues \u2013 but it\u2019s good to consider their water footprints all the same.\nPeanuts are packed with healthy fats too, and their sat fat levels are on par with other nuts, like pecans, cashews, and walnuts.\n(Of course, peanuts are technically legumes \u2013 but let\u2019s not get too nutty with our sorting here.) And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation\u2019s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don\u2019t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou\u2019ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you\u2019re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to give you plenty of permutations for your trail mix, so I do hope you find some recipes to your liking.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate,

walnuts, etc.\nIn fact right now, almond farms in the Murray-Darling Basin are struggling with water supply.\nMany farmers are worried there won\u2019t be enough water to go around, and it\u2019s in part because almond trees use up too much of it compared to other crops.\nLast year, a Canadian pension fund bought up $490 million in water rights in the Murray-Darling to water almond trees.\nWhile some are locally grown or imported from the Middle East, chances are, when you\u2019re buying nuts at the supermarket, they\u2019re from the Golden State.\nCalifornia actually produces nuts for the whole world, despite being a dry state which spent most of the last decade enduring its worst drought in 1,200 years.\nAlmond farms account for 10% of the state\u2019s water use \u2013 more than any individual city.\nThere\u2019s even a single pistachio farm which uses more water than the whole of LA.\nMeanwhile, an upcoming documentary, Pistachio Wars, explores the pistachio industry\u2019s push for a war with Iran, but again, it also looks at how much the Californian nut farms disregard environmental stewardship responsibilities.\nHere\u2019s what we can to do be more conscious nut consumers: Peanuts and cashews \u2013 two nuts which technically aren\u2019t nuts \u2013 are much easier on the environment than almonds or pistachios.\nThey don\u2019t need a tonne of water or pesticides, and can be grown in really poor soil where other crops won\u2019t grow.\nBuying nuts grown anywhere other than California is a step in the right direction.\nWhile there are some issues with almonds grown in the Murray-Darling basin, in general, Aussie-grown nuts won\u2019t be as terrible for the environment.\nBecause they\u2019re being grown in their natural environment, they don\u2019t need an ungodly (and unseasonable) amount of water to thrive.\nIt\u2019s important to be conscious of what and how much we consume, and going easy on the nuts surely won\u2019t be the end of the world."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.foodingredientsfirst.com\/news\/conscious-indulgence-highly-sustainable-macadamia-nut-market-forecast-for-growth.html","1":"grist.org\/food\/what-are-the-most-eco-friendly-nuts\/","2":"www.pedestrian.tv\/bites\/nuts-bad-for-environment-almonds-pistachios\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

suggests that regularly eating macadamia nuts can help prevent coronary artery disease, a type of cardiovascular disease.\nA 2015 review of six studies found that macadamia nuts helped decrease risk factors for cardiovascular disease by reducing cholesterol levels and helping with inflammation and oxidative stress (causes damage to cells.\nResearch suggests that macadamia nuts may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels, which can also help reduce their risk of metabolic syndrome.\nA 2014 meta-analysis also found that tree nuts help improve the glycemic control of people with diabetes, which may be due to a combination of fiber, monounsaturated fats, and other nutrients.\nThe soluble fiber in macadamia nuts may work like a prebiotic to feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut as well as improve your digestive health.\nThe amount of fiber and protein found in macadamia nuts may reduce feelings of hunger and help you feel full, which may support weight loss.\nThey also contain various essential nutrients such as dietary fiber and antioxidants that help reduce the risk or manage conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and digestive
