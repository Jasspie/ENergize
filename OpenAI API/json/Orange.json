equivalent of 1.5 miles or 2.5 kilometers, UK market data, oranges have a relatively low carbon footprintDestruction: low, orange production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nOranges are alkaline when fresh.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nYes, oranges are vegan.\nOranges are a citrus fruit and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day

around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"To achieve this goal, we are following a strict energy efficiency policy, increasing our consumption of renewable energies, developing our circular economy and investing in carbon capture solutions to reduce our residual emissions.\nFrom eco-design to collecting, reconditioning, repairing, recycling and increasing the overall lifespan of products: these are some of the key principles behind the circular economy.\nWe\u2019re committed to ensuring 100% of our Orange-branded products are eco-designed by 2025.\nAnother priority is to change our energy consumption in our operating countries to incorporate more natural resources.","2":"Food Facts:

high polyphenol and fiber content, which moderates the rise in blood sugar (3Trusted Source).\nOranges are a good source of fiber.\nOranges are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C, thiamine, folate, and potassium.\nOranges are rich in various bioactive plant compounds, which are believed to be responsible for many beneficial health effects.\nOranges are an excellent source of phenolic compounds \u2014 especially flavonoids, which contribute to most of their antioxidant properties.\nAll citrus fruits are high in carotenoids antioxidants, which are responsible for their rich color.\nOranges and other citrus fruits are high in citric acid and citrates, which contribute to their sour taste.\nResearch indicates that citric acid and citrates from oranges may help prevent kidney stone formation (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nOranges are a rich source of several plant compounds that are responsible for many of their health benefits.\nFlavonoids \u2014 especially hesperidin \u2014 in oranges may have protective effects against heart disease (11Trusted Source, 16).\nClinical studies in humans note that daily intake of orange juice for four weeks has a blood-thinning effect and may reduce blood pressure significantly (11Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nTaken together, it is likely that regular consumption of oranges may help lower your risk of heart disease.\nOranges are a good source of citric acid and citrates, which are believed to help prevent kidney stone formation.\nCitrates in oranges seem to have similar effects (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nAlthough oranges are not a good source of iron, they are an excellent source of organic acids, such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and citric acid.\nWhen eaten with iron-rich food, oranges may help prevent anemia.\nOranges may benefit heart health and help prevent kidney stones.\nOne cup (240 ml) of pure orange juice has a similar amount of natural sugar as 2 whole oranges and is much less filling (4Trusted Source).\nOranges are among the world\u2019s most popular fruits, as they\u2019re both tasty and nutritious.\nOrange juice is the most popular fruit juice worldwide but opinions differ on whether it's healthy.\nThis article looks at orange juice and whether\u2026 Eating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.\nThough orange juice is high in vital nutrients and enjoyed worldwide, some people doubt it contributes to a healthy diet.","1":"Citrus fruits are a terrific source, but oranges (with a medium-size orange coming in at about 62 calories) also provide a number of other protective nutrients.\nFoods can provide 20% of your daily fluid needs, and water-rich foods like oranges contribute even more to the daily requirement.\nConsuming enough daily fluid helps support mental and physical energy, improve circulation, optimize organ function, flush out waste, and maximize metabolism.\nThe fiber in oranges supports digestive function, helps regulate blood sugar and insulin levels, boosts feelings of fullness, and can even contribute to healthy sleep.\nThis type of fiber has been shown to help reduce blood cholesterol and fend off internal belly fat called visceral fat.\nOne study that tracked adults over five years found that for each 10-gram increase in soluble fiber consumed, the rate of visceral belly fat accumulation decreased by 3.7%.\nThat\u2019s significant: Carrying more visceral fat is linked to increased inflammation and a greater risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and some cancers.\nIn addition to supporting immune function, this key nutrient helps produce collagen, reduce inflammation, and boost the body's ability to use fat as a fuel source, both during exercise and at rest.\nA higher flavonoid intake is also linked to the prevention of weight gain and reduced body fat.\nHealth-protective nutrients aren\u2019t only found in oranges and orange juice; they\u2019re also in the peel.\nResearch shows that flavonoids in citrus peels may help prevent the reproduction, growth, and spread of cancer cells, as well as support apoptosis, the self-destruct sequence the body uses to kill off dysfunctional cells.\nOne older University of Arizona study concluded that eating one tablespoon of citrus zest per week may reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer by 30%.\nWhile whole oranges are more filling and provide more fiber, juice can count as part of your daily fruit intake.\nOne study found that a higher intake of citrus juice was linked to improvements in cognitive function in older adults.\nAnother found that flavanone-rich citrus juice in quantities commonly consumed can enhance blood flow to the brain in healthy, young adults.","2":"We\u2019ve all heard the saying \u201can apple a day keeps the doctor away.\u201d But with all of the antioxidants, micronutrients and health-promoting properties crammed inside the orange, it\u2019s safe to say that oranges may be just as effective in keeping you healthy.\nIn fact, the orange nutrition profile contains a good chunk of the fiber, vitamin C, folate, thiamine\u00a0and potassium that you need in the entire day.\nEating oranges \u2014 along with using orange oil \u2014 has been associated with numerous health benefits, from reducing the risk of heart disease to fighting cancer.\nWith the many varieties of oranges available from kumquats to clementines to cara caras and beyond, there are plenty of ways to enjoy this delicious citrus fruit and get the benefits of orange nutrition.\nOranges are low in calories but contain a good amount of fiber and vitamin C as well as a range of other important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nOrange juice nutrition, on the other hand, is higher in calories and sugar, plus lower in fiber.\nCitrus fruits like oranges are packed with health-promoting antioxidants.\nAntioxidants are believed to play a role in the development of conditions like heart disease, cancer and diabetes.\n(3) In particular, oranges are high in bioflavonoids like\u00a0hesperidin and\u00a0hesperetin, which have been shown in test-tube studies to help neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation and decrease oxidative damage to cells.\nOne review published in the\u00a0Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism showed that getting enough vitamin C could help reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of respiratory tract infections like the common cold.\n(5) Thanks to their high antioxidant content, some research indicates that getting your daily dose of oranges could help protect against and prevent the development of cancer.\nIn fact, eating more citrus fruit has been associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer.\nOne study in Korea, for example, found that having a high intake of citrus fruits was associated with a 10 percent reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer.\n(6) Other research has found similar inverse associations between citrus fruit intake and the risk of other types of cancer, including esophageal, pancreatic, stomach and\u00a0 prostate cancer.\nMultiple studies have found that upping your intake of citrus fruits like oranges could do everything from improve your cholesterol levels to protect against coronary heart disease.\n(13) Similarly, another study published in the\u00a0Journal of Epidemiology\u00a0showed that frequent consumption of citrus fruits was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nA study in the\u00a0British Journal of Nutrition\u00a0even found that a higher intake of citrus fruits was linked to improvements in cognitive function among older adults.\n(17, 18) As a common ingredient in many skin care products, it\u2019s no secret that the orange fruit benefits for skin are pretty impressive.\nIn fact, some research shows that certain types of oranges may even been be able to help fight and reverse skin aging.\nIn one test-tube study, tangerine peels were shown to have anti-aging, anti-wrinkle properties thanks to their antioxidant content.\n(19) Another study published in the\u00a0Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology showed that supplementation with an extract from blood oranges helped protect against UV-induced skin damage and decreased age spot pigmentation by 20 percent.\none medium orange, for example, oranges contain less calories and fiber but are higher in vitamin C, folate, thiamine and potassium.\nApple consumption has been associated with numerous health benefits, and studies show that apples may protect against conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes and even asthma.\n(21) While there may be some distinct differences between apples and oranges, each brings a unique set of nutrients and health benefits to the table and can make a positive addition to your diet.\nSailors were often encouraged to drink orange and lemon juice to help prevent scurvy and citrus trees were even planted along trade routes.\nWhile orange nutrition benefits are pretty impressive, it\u2019s important to remember that the same benefits may not extend to orange juice.\nThis is because oranges contain a good amount of fiber, which helps slow the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream.\nOrange juice, on the other hand, provides a concentrated amount of the sugar found in oranges, without any of the beneficial fiber.\nAlthough rare, some people may be allergic to citrus fruits like oranges."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/oranges","1":"www.health.com\/food\/health-benefits-oranges","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/orange-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
