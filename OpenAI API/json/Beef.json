Some companies are researching ways to replace the more complex cuts of meat that drive the market.\nThese companies aren\u2019t replacing beef with substitutes; they\u2019re trying to grow it in the lab using stem cells.\nNor is it clear that they would have an overall positive impact, unless we are sure that this meat can be made in a more energy-efficient way than we can raise cattle.\nSome believe that raising cattle on pastures, from birth until slaughter, might sequester carbon in the soil better than having cows finish their growth on feed lots.\n\u201cGrass-feeding cattle without grain is the norm in New Zealand, but almost no one in the United States does it,\u201d Dr. Taber said.\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that it would probably take longer to raise cows this way, giving them more time to emit methane.\nAnd feeding seaweed to cows, even in small amounts, can significantly reduce their methane burps.\nOne problem with seaweed is that the component that helps reduce methane emissions is classified as a carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nA larger problem is that we are unprepared to farm the unbelievable amount of seaweed it would take to feed all the cattle the world is raising.\nUntil people are truly ready to reduce consumption of dairy or consumption of higher-end beef cuts, or to commit to raising cattle differently, it seems unlikely that any of the changes with respect to ground beef will make a significant environmental difference in the near future.","1":"It is also valuable where cattle convert crop residues and by-products into edible products and where they contribute to soil fertility through their impact on nutrients and organic matter cycles.\nThey chiefly relate to the low efficiency of beef cattle in converting natural resources into edible products.\nBeef production is faced with a range of additional sustainability challenges, such as changing consumer perceptions, resilience to climate change, animal health and inequities in access to land and water resources.\nCattle; Feedlots; Mitigation; Natural resource use; Production systems;

everyone should know!"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet (1Trusted Source).\nHere are the nutrition facts for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of broiled, ground beef with 10% fat content (2Trusted Source): Meat \u2014 such as beef \u2014 is mainly composed of protein.\nThe protein content of lean, cooked beef is about 26\u201327% (2Trusted Source).\nAnimal protein is usually of high quality, containing all nine essential amino acids needed for the growth and maintenance of your body (3Trusted Source).\nMeat is one of the most complete dietary sources of protein, its amino acid profile being almost identical to that of your own muscles.\nFor this reason, eating meat \u2014 or other sources of animal protein \u2014 may be of particular benefit after surgery and for recovering athletes.\nLean meat is generally about 5\u201310% fat (4Trusted Source).\nBeef contains varying amounts of fat, including CLA, which has been linked to health benefits.\nLike plants, meat contains a number of bioactive substances and antioxidants, which may affect health when consumed in adequate amounts.\nAnimal meat like beef contains a number of bioactive substances, such as creatine, taurine, CLA, and cholesterol.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Beef is a rich source of high-quality protein and various vitamins and minerals.\nLike all types of meat, beef is an excellent source of high-quality protein.\nInadequate protein intake may accelerate age-related muscle wasting, increasing your risk of an adverse condition known as sarcopenia (23Trusted Source).\nThe best dietary sources of protein are animal-derived foods, such as meat, fish, and milk products.\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle, regular consumption of beef \u2014 or other sources of high-quality protein \u2014 may help preserve muscle mass, reducing your risk of sarcopenia.\nIt\u2019s formed in your body from beta-alanine, a dietary amino acid found in high amounts in fish and meat \u2014 including beef.\nSupplementing with high doses of beta-alanine for 4\u201310 weeks has been shown to lead to a 40\u201380% increase in carnosine levels in muscles (26Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nIn contrast, following a strict vegetarian diet may lead to lower levels of carnosine in muscles over time (29Trusted Source).\nIn human muscles, high levels of carnosine have been linked to reduced fatigue and improved performance during exercise (26Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nOnly found in animal-derived foods, heme iron is often very low in vegetarian \u2014 and especially vegan \u2014 diets (35Trusted Source).\nThus, meat not only contains a highly bioavailable form of iron but also improves the absorption of non-heme iron from plant foods \u2014 a mechanism that has not been fully explained and is referred to as the \u201cmeat factor.\u201d A few studies indicate that meat can increase the absorption of non-heme iron even in meals that contain phytic acid, an inhibitor of iron absorption (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that meat supplements were more effective than iron tablets at maintaining iron status in women during a period of exercise (39Trusted Source).\nRich in high-quality protein, beef may help maintain and grow muscle mass.\nObservational studies on red meat and heart disease provide mixed results.\nFor example, many health-conscious people avoid red meat because it has been claimed to be unhealthy (44Trusted Source).\nThe most popular is the diet-heart hypothesis \u2014 the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease by raising cholesterol levels in your blood.\nNot all studies observe a significant link between saturated fat and heart disease (47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source).\nStill, most health authorities advise people to limit their intake of saturated fat \u2014 including beef tallow.\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle, it\u2019s unlikely that moderate amounts of unprocessed lean beef have any adverse effects on heart health.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether meat consumption or saturated fats in beef increase your risk of heart disease.\nMany observational studies link high meat consumption to an increased risk of colon cancer \u2014 but not all studies find a significant association (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).\nA large number of studies indicate that eating well-done meat \u2014 or other dietary sources of heterocyclic amines \u2014 may increase your risk of various cancers (64Trusted Source).\nOne of these studies found that women who ate well-done meat regularly had a 4.6-fold increased risk of breast cancer (71Trusted Source).\nTaken together, some evidence suggests that eating high amounts of well-done meat may increase your risk of cancer.\nIncreased cancer risk may also be related to unhealthy lifestyle factors often associated with high meat intake, such as not eating enough fruit, vegetables, and fiber.\nHigh consumption of overcooked meat may increase the risk of several types of cancer.\nBeef has been linked to a few adverse health conditions \u2014 other than heart disease and cancer.\nPeople with hemochromatosis should limit their consumption of red meat, such as beef and lamb (78Trusted Source).\nPlus, as a rich source of iron, high beef consumption may contribute to excess iron accumulation \u2014 especially in people with hemochromatosis.\nIt\u2019s exceptionally rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals.\nHigh consumption of processed meat and overcooked meat has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.\nThis article explains the difference between grass- and grain-fed\u2026 Eating processed meat is linked to increased risk of several diseases, including cancer.","1":"Nutritionist Michael Joseph publishes the Nutrition Advance website in the US which provides independent, evidence-based\u00a0nutrition and health information backed by peer-reviewed studies as evidence.\nHere he takes a closer look at the health benefits of beef.\nA generation or two ago, our parents and grandparents viewed beef as a nutritious health food.\nWhatever our opinion on\u00a0red meat\u00a0might be, there are some important health benefits of eating beef.\nL-carnitine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in meat products.\nIt\u2019s important to clarify that our body can synthesize sufficient amounts of L-carnitine for general needs; this makes it a non-essential amino acid.\nThe body synthesizes L-Carnitine within the liver and the process relies on the amino acids L-lysine and L-methionine (2).\nHowever, research suggests that a higher dietary intake of L-Carnitine may have some positive health impacts.\nA systematic review shows that higher L-carnitine intake in type 2 diabetes patients improves fasting glucose levels and the overall cholesterol profile (5).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while there are many L-carnitine supplements around,\u00a0the absorption rate is poor in comparison to beef.\nKey Point:\u00a0L-carnitine is an amino acid that naturally occurs in beef.\nAs a result, keeping glutathione levels high is important for our overall health.\nOn the positive side, beef also contains a reasonably high source of complete (pre-formed) dietary glutathione.\nKey Point:\u00a0Keeping our glutathione levels high is critical for good health, and beef is a food that helps us to achieve this.\nBeef is packed with health-promoting amino acids, and it\u2019s one of the single biggest sources of protein in the human diet.\nConsidering this, we should ensure we\u2019re eating a sufficient amount of protein \u2013 this is especially essential for\u00a0elderly people.\nOn this note, beef is one of the best protein-rich foods out there.\nKey Point:\u00a0Protein is essential for optimal health, and especially so as we age.\nSo, the nutritional value of beef can help fight prevalent global deficiencies in iron, magnesium, and zinc (14,\u00a015,\u00a016).\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef is rich in several essential minerals\u2014especially iron, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc.\nGlobally it\u2019s even worse, and according to the World Health Organization, 1.62\u00a0billion\u00a0people suffer from iron deficiency anemia (18).\nOne of the best health benefits of beef meat is that\u00a0it contains a substantial amount of heme iron.\nPerhaps this isn\u2019t a huge surprise when we think about how society seems to shame women who eat meat.\nKey Point:\u00a0Eat more beef to help prevent iron deficiency anemia.\nAnother advantage of eating beef is that it provides an abundance of carnosine.\nCarnosine (beta-analyl-L-histidine) is an amino acid found throughout the body, and it has several important roles in human health.\nAs\u00a0beef is one of the highest sources of carnosine\u00a0(containing about 50% more than poultry), this is another health benefit.\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef (and red meat in general) is the best dietary source of carnosine.\nIt\u2019s important to realize that insufficient vitamin B12 may also increase the risk of depression and mental health issues (25,\u00a026).\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef is high in B vitamins which help promote health.\nVitamin B12 is particularly important since it isn\u2019t present in plant-based foods.\nAlthough all beef contains CLA,\u00a0grass-fed meat\u00a0offers a significantly higher amount than beef from non-ruminants.\nSpecifically, the average amount of CLA in grass-fed beef is 0.46% of the fat content.\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef\u2014especially from grass-fed cows\u2014is one of the highest sources of conjugated linoleic acid.\nNot only are all of these amino acids present in beef, but beef is one of the single most significant dietary sources for them.\nIn other words, eating beef gives you a decent amount of dietary creatine, and it helps your body to produce it too.\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef has two positive impacts on creatine levels.\nWe may hear how beef is so much more expensive than vegetables and other plant-based foods.\n200g of beef will typically provide around 550 calories, but 200g of broccoli only contains 70 calories (11,\u00a037).\nKey Point:\u00a0Per calorie, beef is a very affordable food \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper than vegetables.\nKey Point:\u00a0Beef requires minimal preparation, and it\u2019s quick and simple to cook.\nBeef contains dozens of health-promoting nutrients that we\u00a0need\u00a0in our diet.\nBottom line: there are many health benefits of eating beef.\nI love to eat beef and I will maintain to use this healthy diet Very nice.beef meat good for human body.\nBut is beef meat good for persons over 40years?\nI\u2019m sure it will be back, but I\u2019m going to test out this theory that beef supplied a nutrient to help me get over my tinnitus, even if it\u2019s temporary.\nEat real food, find what works for you.\nI have been red meat deficient for a long time now and last evening I had a steak and the instant health lift was a positive moment for me.\nBeef liver especially is a healthy source of this valuable nutrient.\nThe reason women are more prone to anemia has nothing to do with society\u2019s view of women eating meat vs.\nThanks for telling me that eating beef can help our body build more lean muscle mass.\nThanks a lot  Looking into grass-fed beef I was able to find that omega 3\u2019s are so minimal it is almost not statistically significant to categorize it as such.\nTilbuster Pastoral Co. I am sure that grassfed beef has one of the highest levels of omega 3\u2019s of any food including salmon, we all know the health benefits of this.\nHopefully this wakes up a bunch of people and gets them to eat beef.","2":"Beef is one of the foods with high nutritional value and contain many essential amino acids, fats, minerals, vitamins\u2026In addition to providing human beings with the important and precious nutritional values; beef also brings about many benefits for health that people should know.\nTherefore, in the article today, I would like to show you the best health benefits of beef and nutritional benefits of beef that you should know to make use of this material in your daily meals.\nBeef, especially beef shank, is rich in ammonia acid, higher than any other kinds of food, working well to increase muscle mass; especially, strengthening the body's overall health.\nBeef contains huge amounts of vitamin B6 and protein so that it should be added in the daily diet in a regular basis.\nBeef contains a lot of important and essential minerals which are necessary for building muscle, including protein, potassium \u2013 the 2 minerals that are indispensable in the diet of a bodybuilder.\nTherefore, people who want to build lean muscle mass should eat more beef in a regular basis.\nAs I mentioned above, beef is an excellent source of vitamin B6\u00a0and protein which should be added into in the daily diet regularly for good.\nProtein supports the metabolism and synthesis of food, contributing to the body recovery after intense activity.\nA 3 \u2013 ounce serving of beef provides people with about half the average amount of protein \u00a0which an adult needs to consume in their daily meals.\nThe amount of protein you get from beef contains all the amino acids which are needed to repair tissue and build muscles.\nCarnitine is mainly used to support the metabolism of fats and amino acid sequence to keep the body balanced, and the amino acids are good and necessary for creating muscle.\nBeef contains many minerals, such as protein, potassium \u2013 the two minerals that are indispensable in the daily diet.\nTherefore, people should add potassium to their daily meals, and one of the best health benefits of beef is that it is an excellent source of potassium.\nAnother benefit of adding lean beef to the daily diet is that it is one of the excellent sources of zinc.\nYou need to take zinc from foods because it helps to build muscle mass, strengthen the immune system and support the health of your brain.\nYou should add beef to your daily meals for a healthy diet once or twice a week to take the necessary amount of iron for your body\u2019s red blood cells, helping to transport the sufficient amount of oxygen to all parts of the body.\nVitamin B12 promotes the metabolism of chain amino acid branches, thus providing the essential amount of energy to the body during intense activity.\nRecent studies indicated that Conjugated Linoleic Acid may play an important role in cancer prevention by inhibiting the growth and development of the tumor, as well as affecting the body\u2019s composition by developing lean muscle mass and reducing body fat."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/beef","1":"www.beefcentral.com\/news\/community-and-lifestyle\/beef-nutrition\/11-health-benefits-of-eating-beef\/","2":"vkool.com\/benefits-of-beef\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":" 70","2":" 50"}}
