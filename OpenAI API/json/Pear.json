growing concern about the environment and farming practices, and how our food production systems and distribution systems may be contributing to problems such as transport pollution, global warming and loss of wildlife and biodiversity.\nTraditional orchards are valuable habitats for wildlife and their loss has an important negative impact on nature conservation.\nApples and pears are important both for the wildlife supported by traditionally managed orchards and for the many varieties of fruit which exist, often with traditional local, culinary and seasonal uses.\nAnother problem of long-distance transport of food is that, in order to preserve the fruit during transit, they are routinely treated with post-harvest pesticides and waxed to prevent wrinkling, improving their appearance and extending their shelf-life.\nThe Department of Health now recommends peeling orchard fruit to help avoid pesticide residues being eaten by children.\nThe reports call for greater support for local, traditional orchards, producing fruit using sustainable agricultural methods including organic production.\nAnd they call for supermarkets to take a lead in stocking local varieties of fruit transported direct to the nearest branches, where they can be promoted and marketed for their positive environmental and health qualities.\nFood Facts: A series of short reports on over a dozen different products, shows how people's shopping choices - as well as government policy - can protect the environment, enhance social justice and improve health.\nsustain@sustainweb.org Sustain

ornamental in 1964 by the US Department of Agriculture, it was known then that this tree possessed the weakest branch structure in nature.\nBradford pears will seldom last more than 20 years before they bust themselves apart at the seams.\nThat\u2019s little consolation for the resulting disasters that happened when these other pear varieties were introduced.\nHowever, the fact that Bradford pear trees are short lived and dangerous is not the real reason that these trees are such a disaster.\nNo two Bradford pears will ever reproduce among themselves, but they do cross pollinate with every other pear tree out there, including the Cleveland Select pear trees that were meant to be the salvation of flowering pears everywhere.\nBecause of the cross pollination problem, pear trees have now proliferated exponentially across our environment.\nThat solitary Bradford pear growing in your yard is what caused this problem.\nIf you don\u2019t believe that, just take a little ride, and

Source).\nAs pear skin contains a substantial amount of fiber, it\u2019s best to eat this fruit unpeeled (2Trusted Source).\nThese compounds may improve heart health and strengthen blood vessels (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nThough specific research on pear anthocyanins is needed, numerous population studies suggest that a high intake of anthocyanin-rich foods like berries is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease (16Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s linked to certain illnesses, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes (20Trusted Source).\nPears are a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants, which help fight inflammation and may decrease your risk of disease (14Trusted Source).\nSeveral large reviews tie high flavonoid intake to a reduced risk of heart disease and diabetes.\nA few studies indicate that diets rich in fruits, including pears, may protect against some cancers, including those of the lung, stomach, and bladder (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nSome population studies suggest that flavonoid-rich fruits like pears may also safeguard against breast and ovarian cancers, making this fruit a particularly smart choice for women (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nWhile eating more fruit may reduce your cancer risk, more research is needed.\nOne large study in over 200,000 people found that eating 5 or more weekly servings of anthocyanin-rich fruits like red pears was associated with a 23% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, a mouse study noted that plant compounds, including anthocyanins, in pear peel exhibited both anti-diabetes and anti-inflammatory effects (35).\nThe peel contains an important antioxidant called quercetin, which is thought to benefit heart health by decreasing inflammation and reducing heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol levels (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nOne study in 40 adults with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that increases your heart disease risk, found that eating 2 medium pears each day for 12 weeks lowered heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure and waist circumference (41Trusted Source).\nA large, 17-year study in over 30,000 women revealed that every daily 80-gram portion of fruit decreased heart disease risk by 6\u20137%.\nFurthermore, regular intake of pears and other white-fleshed fruits is thought to lower stroke risk.\nOne 10-year study in over 20,000 people determined that every 25 grams of white-fleshed fruit eaten daily decreased stroke risk by 9% (43Trusted Source).\nIn one 12-week study, 40 adults who ate 2 pears daily lost up to 1.1 inches (2.7 cm) off their waist circumference (41Trusted Source).\nThey also saw improvements in their lipid profile, a marker of heart health (44Trusted Source).\nPears are a powerhouse fruit, packing fiber, vitamins, and beneficial plant compounds.\nThese nutrients are thought to fight inflammation, promote gut and heart health, protect against certain diseases, and even aid weight loss.\nTypical symptoms can include\u2026 Eating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.\nFruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants.\nFruit is linked to many health benefits, but it contains sugar, leading many to question its effects on weight loss.","1":"(1) That\u2019s a good thing, considering the wonderful benefits pear nutrition provides.\nFor instance, pears have the ability to fight chronic diseases by supplying high levels of antioxidants.\nStudies regarding pear nutrition have linked the\u00a0fruit\u2019s\u00a0consumption with lower levels of constipation,\u00a0kidney stones, high cholesterol and even diabetes.\nThey provide high amounts of vitamin C, vitamin K and boron, which aid in bone health, and pear nutrition also helps reverse\u00a0copper deficiency\u00a0and\u00a0low potassium.\nThey are considered a pomaceous fruit that grow on a number of different pear trees.\nDifferent types of pears have similar health benefits, including their high fiber content, vitamin C and antioxidants.\nThis is why it\u2019s a good idea to eat pears with their skins\/peels on.\nPears are a bit more calorie-dense than berries, stone fruit like nectarines or peaches, or melon such as cantaloupe, but they are still a low-calorie food overall.\nAlthough pears and other fruits or vegetables do contain natural sugars in the form of the fructose, studies show that\u00a0higher fruit and vegetable intake is inversely associated with diabetes incidence, especially among women.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about consuming too much sugar \u2014 for example because you follow the ketogenic diet or a low-carb diet \u2014 but you still want to include fruit in your diet for the fiber, consider having half an avocado daily.\nAvocado is another high-fiber fruit but contains much less carbs and sugar (and much more healthy fat!).\nOne reason is because pears provide a good dose of the daily vitamin C you need.\nOne fresh, medium-sized pear contains about 10 percent to 12 percent of the recommended dietary allowance\u00a0for vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid).\nYes, pear nutrition benefits your skin due to its vitamin C content.\nConsuming vitamin C from\u00a0high-antioxidant foods\u00a0like pears helps increase skin\u2019s\u00a0immunity.\nEating pears is a great way to make sure you cover your bases of 25\u201330 grams of fiber daily.\nOne of the most researched aspects of pear nutrition is pears\u2019 compound called pectin fiber.\nPectin\u00a0fiber is more than just a regulator; it\u2019s a\u00a0type of special beneficial fiber that\u2019s water-soluble and helps lower cholesterol and increases digestive health.\nIn addition to vitamin C, pear skins (or peels) also contain important phytonutrients.\nThese are mostly found in the skin of pears and can help ward off disease formation, so don\u2019t peel your fruit!\nIn fact, when researchers studied the antioxidant capacity of pears and apples, they found that\u00a0diets that included the fruit peels had a significantly higher level of healthy fatty acids (higher plasma lipid levels) and antioxidant activity\u00a0than diets that discarded the peels and only ate the fruit\u2019s pulp.\n(7) Diets high in fresh fruit, including pears, have also gained a lot of attention for having anti-inflammatory and cancer-protective effects.\nThose essential nutrients and antioxidants make pears one of the better\u00a0anti-inflammatory foods\u00a0around.\nAnother important way\u00a0pear nutrition benefits you?\nAccording to studies by the National Cancer Institute,\u00a0consuming fresh fruit daily shows positive effects on the body\u2019s ability to prevent cancer growth, reduce inflammation, remain in\u00a0pH balance, decrease oxidative damage to lipids and improve antioxidant status in healthy humans.\nOver and over we see that\u00a0the more fresh vegetables and fruit someone eats, the less likely she is to gain weight\u00a0and struggle to maintain her health.\n(9) Longitudinal studies among overweight adults find that a\u00a0high-fiber diet\u00a0coming from fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with slower weight gain.\nOne of the most noteworthy pear nutrition benefits is that pears can protect your heart by providing antioxidants, vitamins and fiber.\nThe\u00a0beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables\u00a0are probably due to the presence of antioxidant phytochemicals that keep arteries clear, lower inflammation and prevent high levels of oxidative stress.\n(10) We also know that the specific type of fiber found in pears called pectin is very useful in helping\u00a0lower cholesterol levels naturally.\nThis supports the general health recommendation to consume multiple servings of fruits and vegetables (ideally five to nine a day of different types).\nAs a high-fiber food that provides essential nutrients, eating more pears is a great way to prevent or treat digestive issues.\nThis means either eating whole pears (including the skin), blending them into a smoothie or drinking pear juice can help regulate bowel movements, prevent water retention and decrease bloating.\nThe phytonutrients found in pears and other fruit protect the digestive organs from oxidative stress.\nResearchers now know that certain flavonoids in fruits, including pears, can improve insulin sensitivity.\nAfter following over 9,600 adults ages 25\u201374 for about 20 years, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that eating five or more servings of combined fruits and vegetables daily significantly cut the risk of diabetes formation.\n(13) Pears are considered a fruit low on the\u00a0glycemic index.\nBecause of the high fiber content in pears, they unleash sugar into the bloodstream slowly and therefore have a low glycemic load.\nLike all fruit, eating pears can provide you with a quick boost of energy before a workout.\nPears are a good source of two nutrients that are key to skeletal health: vitamin K and boron.\nEven centuries ago, populations knew that pear nutrition benefited\u00a0digestive health\u00a0and could be used to promote \u201cregularity,\u201d fight dehydration and even reduce fevers.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, it\u2019s recommended that fruits, including pears, be eaten when they are ripe and in season.\nBenefits of pears according to TCM include clearing coughs, improving breathing, reducing constipation and moisturizing the skin.\n(15)\u00a0Pears are recommended either baked or eaten fresh, depending on the climate and how well they are digested.\nThe juice of pears is a great way to sweeten smoothies and recipes without adding refined sugar.\nBecause pears are high in fiber, it\u2019s best to introduce them to your diet slowly if you currently don\u2019t eat much fiber.\nWhile they all differ a bit in terms of taste and appearance, pear nutrition benefits for all types are pretty similar.\nWhat are potential side effects of eating pears?\nPears are often recommended by health care practitioners because they\u2019re considered a hypoallergenic fruit.\nCan you eat too many pears?\nAlthough pears have multiple benefits, as with all fruit they do contain sugar.\nInclude pears as part of a diet that\u2019s also filled with plenty of vegetables, healthy fats and proteins.\nPlan to eat pears (and all fruit) in moderation balanced by other low-sugar foods.","2":"The proven health benefits of pears may include their ability to aid in weight loss, improve digestion, boost heart health, and can help regulate blood pressure.\nPears are a low-cal, high-fiber fruit favored in weight management programs.\nPears also contain active and effective components including potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, phenolic compounds, folate, dietary fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium, as well as B-complex vitamins.\nA 2015 study suggested that the phenolic content in the peel of Bartlett and Starkrimson pears and fermented pear juice may play a vital role in promoting gut health.\n[4] A study published in Nutrition Today led by Dr. Joanne Slavin, who is a professor at the University of Minnesota, concludes that fruits like pears are extremely great sources of dietary fiber.\n[5] While a single serving of pears provides 18% of the daily requirement for fiber intake, they can be a very strong agent for improving digestive health too.\n[6]  Like many other fruits, pears are a wealth of antioxidants like vitamin C that combat various diseases and conditions within the body.\nA 2003 research study on the antioxidant activity of pear has revealed that pear fruits may contain a remarkable amount of vitamin C and chlorogenic acid.\nAntioxidant components of vitamin C, vitamin A, and flavonoid compounds like beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, all of which are found in pears can help rid the body of free radicals.\n[8] The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\u00a0published a comprehensive study suggesting the benefits of vitamin C above the recommended daily intake for health benefits like boosting immunity.\nPears are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C can be beneficial for stimulating white blood cell production.\n[9] A 2019 study published in the Current Developments in Nutrition journal showed a positive link between eating apples, pears, or combining apples and pears with a decreased risk of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases such as coronary disease and diabetes.\nNotably, among the fruit and vegetable categories, apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables were linked with decreased risk of stroke.\nThe antioxidant and flavonoid components of the fruit can induce anti-inflammatory effects in the body, reducing the pain and swelling associated with inflammation.\n[12] Word of Caution: There are no known interactions or health risks with the fruit.\nHowever, if you have an allergy to pears or other fruits, be mindful before enjoying them.\nHealth benefits of apple cider vinegar include its ability to\u00a0regulate blood sugar levels, boost weight loss,\u00a0improve skin & gut health, & lower cholesterol levels.Read more!\nThe powerful health benefits of dates include providing an energy boost, increasing iron in the body, and aiding digestion.\nGinger also helps boost bone health, strengthen the immune system, and increase appetite.\nBenefits of calamansi juice include bleaching the skin, detoxifying the body, aiding in weight loss & managing diabetes.\nThey improve digestion & heart health, boost immunity, slow aging, and aid in weight loss."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-pears","1":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/pear-nutrition\/","2":"www.organicfacts.net\/health-benefits\/fruit\/pears.html"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
