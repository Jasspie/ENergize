or 0.75 kilometers, USA market data, watermelon has a relatively low carbon footprintDestruction: low, watermelon production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nAs it turns out it takes significantly more water to yield foods that come from animals than foods that come from plants.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nBuying seasonally reduces carbon emissions from hothouses (greenhouses).\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nWatermelon is a fruit and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food every day worldwide.\nRabbits: An estimated 3 million rabbits are killed for food every day worldwide.\nGeese: An estimated 2 million geese are killed for food around the world every day.\nTurkeys: An estimated 2 million turkeys are killed for food around the world every day.\nSheep: An estimated 1.5 million sheep killed for food around the world every day.\nGoats: An estimated 1.2 million goats are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair trade.","1":"Many of the policy responses to the climate change problem \u2013 consume less, regulate businesses, curb big oil and coal, restrict car use \u2013 feel more comfortable to those on the left than the right of the political spectrum.\nThis is the backdrop to the parliamentary science and technology select committee's inquiry into the communication of climate science, to which I gave evidence on Monday.\nThe thrust of many of their questions was \"what could the media be doing better to communicate the science?\" Don't confer scientific expertise on people who do not deserve it.\nWhile the precise impacts and timescale of climate change may be uncertain, the basic tenets are well-established science.\nAnd let's face it, climate science may be complex, but the Higgs boson is harder to grasp than global warming.\nThe elephant in the room at the parliamentary inquiry though has been that, consciously or not, there are people on all sides of the climate debate who argue backwards from a cultural or political position.\nAs a result, arguments about the science of climate change become a proxy for what is really a political argument.\nIt is perhaps understandable that some on the right have reacted strongly to what they perceive as a left-wing agenda masquerading as science.\nThe truth is that we don't need to return to the Stone Age, but all this has made it much harder to have a sensible discussion about policies to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.\nSo politicians of all stripes need to come up with a coherent response to the profound societal questions raised by climate change.\nSo I repeat the plea I made to the select committee for centre right politicians, thinkers and cultural figures to reclaim the climate change issue and talk about it in language their supporters will understand and warm to.","2":"For optimum fruit production watermelon requires a long growing season with lots of warmth and sun, but some types of watermelon will also produce in cooler climates with shorter seasons.\nWatermelon plants love the heat, and need a long and warm growing season of at least 70 to 85 days, depending on the variety, to produce sweet fruit.\nWatermelon grows best in fertile, well-draining, sandy loam soils.\nMost soils benefit from incorporating a few inches of organic compost before planting, and perhaps some fertilizer as well.\nWatermelon plants need lots of space to grow and spread out.\nThey can also be grown vertically by training them up a trellis to produce a sort of \"watermelon tree,\" if you're short on space, but the vines and fruit will require support.\nAlthough the watermelon's deep root system makes it relatively drought-tolerant, the plant requires an abundance of water to produce healthy fruit.\nThis plant can easily develop fungal foliage problems, so if you must water overhead, do so in the morning so that the foliage has a chance to dry during the day."},"environment_urls":{"0":"healabel.com\/w-ingredients\/watermelon","1":"www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2013\/sep\/11\/watermelon-climate-debate","2":"homeguides.sfgate.com\/environment-watermelon-grow-in-69285.html"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

and vegetables help you feel full.\nVitamin C is an antioxidant that helps prevent cell damage from free radicals.\nThis potent antioxidant gives a red color to plant foods such as tomatoes and watermelon and is linked to many health benefits.\nResearchers have studied lycopene and other individual plant compounds in watermelon for their anti-cancer effects.\nThe strongest link so far seems to be between lycopene and cancers of the digestive system (1Trusted Source).\nHigh IGF levels are linked to cancer (3Trusted Source).\nLifestyle factors, including diet, may lower your risk of heart attack and stroke by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nStudies suggest that lycopene may help lower cholesterol and blood pressure.\nIt can also help prevent oxidative damage to cholesterol (1Trusted Source).\nWatermelon also contains citrulline, an amino acid that may increase nitric oxide levels in the body.\nNitric oxide helps your blood vessels expand, which lowers blood pressure (9Trusted Source).\nWatermelon may help lower inflammation and oxidative damage, as it\u2019s rich in the anti-inflammatory antioxidants lycopene and vitamin C (1Trusted Source).\nCompared to the control group, they developed lower levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein and less oxidative stress (10Trusted Source).\nWatermelon has both lycopene and vitamin C (11Trusted Source).\nBoth watermelon drinks led to less muscle soreness and quicker heart rate recovery, compared to citrulline on its own (13Trusted Source).\nSo far, citrulline doesn\u2019t seem to improve exercise performance in the amounts studied, but it\u2019s still an area of research interest (14Trusted Source).\nTwo vitamins in watermelon \u2014 A and C \u2014 are important for skin and hair health.\nBoth lycopene and beta-carotene may also help protect your skin from sunburn (15Trusted Source).\nWatermelon contains lots of water and a small amount of fiber \u2014 both of which are important for healthy digestion.\nEating water-rich and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, including watermelon, can be very helpful for promoting normal bowel movements.\nIt has a high water content and also delivers many other important nutrients, including lycopene and vitamin C.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.\nThis is an evidence-based review of watermelon, with detailed information on its health benefits, nutrient content, plant compounds and more.","1":"This juicy melon may have several health benefits, including lower blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced muscle soreness.\nThe glycemic index (GI) \u2014 a measure of how quickly foods raise blood sugar levels after meals \u2014 of watermelons ranges from 72\u201380, which is high (2).\nHowever, each serving of watermelon is relatively low in carbs, so eating it should not have a major effect on blood sugar levels.\nEating high amounts of fructose can cause unpleasant digestive symptoms in individuals who cannot fully digest them, such as those with fructose malabsorption (4Trusted Source).\nWatermelon is low in calories and fiber and consists mostly of water and simple sugars.\nWatermelon is a good source of vitamin C and contains decent amounts of potassium, copper, vitamin B5, and vitamin A (from beta carotene).\nWatermelon is a poor source of antioxidants compared to other fruits (9Trusted Source).\nHowever, it\u2019s rich in the amino acid citrulline and the antioxidant lycopene, which have numerous benefits for health (10).\nWatermelon is the richest known dietary source of the amino acid citrulline.\nBoth citrulline and arginine play an important role in the synthesis of nitric oxide, which helps lower blood pressure by dilating and relaxing your blood vessels (13Trusted Source).\nStudies note that watermelon juice is a good source of citrulline and can increase blood levels of both citrulline and arginine considerably (15Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18).\nThough watermelon is one of the best dietary sources of citrulline, you would have to consume about 15 cups (2.3 kg) at once to meet the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for arginine (19Trusted Source).\nWatermelon is the best known fresh source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant responsible for its red color (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23).\nIn fact, fresh watermelon is a better source of lycopene than tomatoes (1Trusted Source).\nHuman studies show that fresh watermelon juice is effective at raising blood levels of both lycopene and beta carotene (24Trusted Source).\nWatermelon is a good source of the amino acid citrulline and the antioxidant lycopene, which play important roles in your body.\nWatermelons and their juice are linked to several health benefits.\nWatermelon is a good source of citrulline, which is converted into arginine in your body.\nWatermelon juice and arginine intake are associated with reduced insulin resistance in some studies (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that watermelon juice is effective at decreasing muscle soreness following exercise (34Trusted Source).\nWatermelon may reduce blood pressure and insulin resistance in some people.\nWatermelon contains relatively high amounts of fructose, a type of FODMAP that some people do not fully digest.\nIt\u2019s loaded with citrulline and lycopene, two powerful plant compounds linked to lower blood pressure, improved metabolic health, and decreased muscle soreness after exercise.\nWatermelon is a delicious low-calorie treat with numerous benefits.","2":"What better way to celebrate, than with a beloved watermelon, which provides us with unique nutrients and health benefits?\nWatermelon is packed with nutrient-dense minerals, fiber (4% DV in 2 cups), and antioxidant-rich phytonutrients, like beta carotene (0.9 mg per 2-cup serving) and lycopene.\nIt contains higher levels of lycopene than any other fresh fruit or vegetable (12.7 mg per 2-cup serving) and is considered a Lycopene Leader.[1] Watermelon is an excellent source of Vitamin C (25% DV) and a source of Vitamin A (8% DV).1,[2] Vitamin C has a key role in immune function, helping to prevent and\/or treat numerous health conditions.\nAt 92% water, watermelon is an excellent and delicious way to help hydrate your body.[5] Proper hydration is one of the most important aspects of health.\nWater carries nutrients and oxygen to cells, moves waste products out of our body, and helps lubricate joints allowing us to exercise and play![6] Eat watermelon all-year-round to up your hydration!\nResearch suggests that people who eat more vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases, including heart disease and some cancers.[7] Watermelon is a wonderful addition to a heart-healthy diet and is proudly American Heart Association Heart-Check Certified.\nVitamin A and Vitamin C are both found in watermelon and these nutrients play a pivotal role in maintaining healthy skin.\nAlthough more research and clinical trials are needed, systematic reviews and meta-analyses link lycopene to a possible role in maintaining healthy skin through sun protection.[9],[10] Try rejuvenating your skin and get glowing with an all-natural, DIY watermelon remedy.\nWatermelon contains both water and fiber (4% DV).\nEating fruits and vegetables that contain both fiber and water, including watermelon, can be very helpful for
