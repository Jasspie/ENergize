and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Buckwheat has become popular as a health food due to its high mineral and antioxidant content.\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw buckwheat are (1Trusted Source): Buckwheat mainly consists of carbs, which make up about 20% of boiled groats by weight (2).\nSome of the soluble carbs in buckwheat, such as fagopyritol and D-chiro-inositol, have been shown to help moderate the rise in blood sugar after meals (4Trusted Source, 5).\nAdditionally, the husk contains resistant starch, which is resistant to digestion and is thus categorized as fiber (6Trusted Source, 7).\nBecause of its well-balanced amino acid profile, the protein in buckwheat is very high quality.\nHowever, the digestibility of these proteins is relatively low because of antinutrients like protease inhibitors and tannins (5, 13Trusted Source).\nIn animals, buckwheat protein has proven effective at lowering blood cholesterol, suppressing gallstone formation, and reducing the risk of colon cancer (13Trusted Source, 14, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nIt also boasts a good amount of fiber and resistant starch, which may improve colon health.\nBuckwheat is richer in minerals than many common cereals, such as rice, wheat, and corn (5).\nThis is because buckwheat is relatively low in phytic acid, a common inhibitor of mineral absorption found in grains and seeds (6Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Buckwheat is rich in various antioxidant plant compounds, which are responsible for many of its health benefits.\nIn fact, it provides more antioxidants than many other cereal grains, such as barley, oats, wheat, and rye (21, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nBuckwheat is richer in antioxidants than many common cereal grains.\nLike other whole-grain pseudocereals, buckwheat is linked to a number of benefits.\nOver time, high levels of blood sugar may lead to various chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes.\nThus, moderating the rise in blood sugar after meals is important for maintaining good health.\nAs a good source of fiber, buckwheat has a low to medium GI.\nIn fact, studies link buckwheat intake to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nThis is supported by a study of rats with diabetes, in which buckwheat concentrate was shown to lower blood sugar levels by 12\u201319% (33Trusted Source).\nIn addition, some components of buckwheat seem to prevent or delay the digestion of table sugar (4Trusted Source).\nOverall, these properties make buckwheat a healthy choice for people with type 2 diabetes or those who want to improve their blood sugar balance.\nIt boasts many heart-healthy compounds, such as rutin, magnesium, copper, fiber, and certain proteins.\nAmong cereals and pseudocereals, buckwheat is the richest source of rutin, an antioxidant that may have a number of benefits (39).\nA study in 850 Chinese adults linked buckwheat intake to lower blood pressure and an improved blood lipid profile, including lower levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol (35Trusted Source).\nBuckwheat may moderate blood sugar levels, making it a healthy choice for people with type 2 diabetes.\nWhat\u2019s more, it may boost heart health by improving blood pressure and your blood lipid profile.\nBuckwheat is a pseudocereal, which is a type of grain that doesn\u2019t grow on grasses but is used similarly to other cereals.\nIt is gluten-free, a good source of fiber, and rich in minerals and various plant compounds, especially rutin.\nAs a result, buckwheat consumption is linked to several health benefits, including improved blood sugar control and heart health.\nThis article covers\u2026 A variety of healthy, gluten-free alternatives to regular or wheat flour exist for those who avoid gluten.","1":"Buckwheat not only

a wheat \u2014 or even a grain.\nThis makes buckwheat a wonderful option for people with celiac disease or anybody else committed to eating a gluten-free diet.\nFar more than a simple alternative, buckwheat offers far more fiber, vitamins, and minerals than the rice products that are often used in gluten-free recipes.\nBuckwheat is rich in fiber.\nThese nutrients found in buckwheat have reportedly helped people with type 2 diabetes manage the condition by improving insulin resistance.\nStudies indicate that people who regularly eat buckwheat products have lower cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose levels.\nBy helping to manage these risk factors, a diet rich in buckwheat helps to reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular disease.\nPreprepared products containing buckwheat flour often include high levels of added sugar.\nFor maximum benefit, eat buckwheat groats prepared at home.\nWhether you enjoy it as flour or groats, buckwheat is a versatile,

buckwheat\u00a0is also\u00a0low in\u00a0FODMAPs, which are types of carbohydrates that can exacerbate digestive issues in some people.\nNutritionists frequently recommend a low FODMAP diet for people who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).7\ufeff Eliminating FODMAPs temporarily can also help identify symptom trigger-foods.\nA study comparing the buckwheat-eating region of Mongolia to the region where buckwheat is not consumed found that populations who eat buckwheat had almost 17% lower fasting blood sugar levels.8\ufeff The low glycemic rating for buckwheat, along with the beneficial

fridge, but when in doubt, throw it out.\nThe simplest way to make buckwheat is by cooking it as a hot cereal out of plain buckwheat groats.\nMost buckwheat groats will include an easy recipe right on the package, but you will likely need to soak your groats overnight in water and then cook them over high heat for a few minutes (follow the recipe on your specific buckwheat groats package for the best results).\nJust note that the recipe proportions will need to be adjusted as buckwheat's high fiber content can make baked goods come out more rough or dry.\nBuckwheat can also be added to soups
