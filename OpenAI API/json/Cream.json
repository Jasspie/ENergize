taste better.\nDespite its taste, heavy cream has traditionally had a bad reputation due to its high-fat content.\nFirstly, heavy cream is a minimally processed dairy product that comes from milk.\nThe production process of cream is very simple and involves skimming the high-butterfat top layer from regular milk.\nAs the table shows, heavy cream has a butterfat content of at least 36%, but it may range up to 40%.\nThe data source is the USDA\u2019s FoodData Central database (5): As shown above, heavy cream provides a large amount of (primarily saturated) fat.\nHeavy cream is an excellent source of vitamin A (retinol) in its most bioavailable form.\nIn truth, natural sources of fat, in reasonable amounts, are nothing to fear and even have benefits for our health.\nDietary fat is important for many processes in our body, so we should acknowledge that it offers health benefits.\nWith its high-fat content, heavy cream perfectly fits this profile (8, 9).\nHeavy cream contains calcium, a mineral that plays an important role in skeletal health.\nWhile both cream and milk contain calcium, the calorie content of each is vastly different.\nDue to the high energy-density of heavy cream, there is a limit to how much we can consume.\nHeavy cream only contains lower amounts of the milk sugar lactose compared to milk.\nHowever, for those that do suffer with a mild sensitivity to lactose, they may be able to handle heavy cream better than milk.\nOn the other hand, heavy cream is 3% lactose by weight and people generally only consume small amounts of it.\nFirstly, to avoid confusion, there is nothing wrong with food containing high amounts of calories or fat.\nHowever, the issue with heavy cream (and other isolated fats like butter and coconut oil) is that they are energy-dense but not very nutrient-dense.\nHeavy cream is a perfectly healthy dairy food, but it lacks nutritional value compared to whole food sources of fat such as eggs, meat or fish.\nSometimes people may have sensitivities to dairy products, or they may not be able to source heavy cream at a time they need it.\nAlthough it won\u2019t be exactly the same, it is an excellent substitute for heavy cream that is equivalent in taste\/fat content.\nA lot of people enjoy heavy cream, but don\u2019t really know what to make with it.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the heavy cream, chicken broth, salt and pepper.\nTo start making the ricotta, first add the whole milk, heavy cream and salt to a pan.\nThere may be a trend for drinking coffee with butter these days, but \u2014 to me at least \u2014 heavy cream tastes so much better.\nYou can add the cream in its fresh chilled state, but it is better if you heat it up first \u2013 a steaming hot coffee is always ideal.\nIf you want something truly indulgent (as a rare treat) then you can also heat a (small) cup of heavy cream and add it to 1 or 2 espresso shots.\nThe latter option tastes unbelievable, but it is extremely high in fat\/calories, so it should only be a rare treat.\nWhen the soup starts to boil, reduce the heat and pour the heavy cream into the pan.\nAt this point, add the basil leaves to the soup and then continue simmering for about ten more minutes.\nHeavy cream is a delicious high-fat dairy food, and when you use it in the kitchen, it leads to great things.\nFor more dairy ideas, see this guide to clotted cream \u2013 a delicious dairy food with a high butterfat content.","2":"That\u2019s why the choice of whipping cream and heavy cream for some people is really important but some product of heavy cream offers you with more delicious taste because of the higher fat content.\nThere are so much treats that could be harmful for your health but whipped cream, though it is not perfect and high in calories, is still considered to be one of the healthy treats you could consume in daily basis.\nJust like any dairy products, whipped cream is also high in calcium which is great for healthy bones.\nFurthermore, the vitamin K found in whipped cream is also relatively high to help you reducing the risk of some bone problems like osteoporosis and bone fracture.\nNot only that, the combinations of vitamins and minerals in whipped could is also excellent for tooth enamel and gum health.\nFolate found in whipped cream is relatively high that could promote the development of brain cells and nerve systems.\nThough the content of vitamin C in whipped cream is not really high but it is enough to help you protecting your body by enhancing your immunity system.\nFurthermore, whipped cream contains high amount of vitamin A which is effective to counteract any infections by producing the opposite compound to the antigen.\nFolate is excellent compound for brain while vitamin B2 and phosphorus are perfect combination to promote healthy growth and nerve system.\nWhipped cream contains adequate amount of folate but contains excellent amount of vitamin B2 and phosphorus which make it one of the super foods for brain.\nOne of the compounds that are great for hair health is protein and as mentioned in the table above, whipped cream is relatively high in protein, since it is a dairy product.\nIt means that you cannot get the same benefits if you are consuming non-dairy whipped cream.\nIt is a common knowledge that all foods that are rich of vitamin A are excellent for vision and whipped cream contains relatively high amount of vitamin A.\nIron and other minerals are essential to the production of red blood cells and luckily, whipped cream is so rich of certain minerals and vitamins.\nNo matter how much health benefits you could get from consuming whipped cream, but you should well aware of some cautions that is lurking behind the delicious taste of whipped cream.\nFurthermore, in cake that is using butter cream by adding some whipped cream will enhance the taste."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthbenefitstimes.com\/cream\/","1":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/heavy-cream-nutrition\/","2":"drhealthbenefits.com\/food-bevarages\/processed-food\/health-benefits-whipped-cream"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
