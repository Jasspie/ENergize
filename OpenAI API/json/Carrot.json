and environmental IMPACT - ScienceDirect"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"There is growing concern about the environment and farming practices and how our food production systems and distribution systems may be contributing to problems such as transport pollution, global warming and loss of wildlife and biodiversity.\nThe key issues concerning carrot production are those of pesticide use and of food miles, the problem of increasingly long distance food transport.\nCarrot crops are hosts for insect populations, which in turn provide food for birds and other wildlife.\nHowever, these insects, the carrot root fly in particular, can damage the crops and most farmers use pesticides to reduce their losses.\nPesticide use on carrots has led to concern about residues in our food as well as damage to the environment.\nConcern peaked in 1995 when the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reported unexpectedly high residues of organophosphate (OP) insecticide in some carrots.\nFour years later, government advice is still to peel and top carrots to reduce the risk of consuming pesticide residues.\nHealth risks associated with pesticides are not just for consumers eating the residues.\nThere have also been some cases of more direct poisoning of wildlife, including Marsh Harriers and Partridges, following pesticide treatment of carrot crops.\nFarmers looking to improve the percentage of the food sales price which they receive have moved into direct marketing through box schemes, farm shops and farmers' markets.\nFood Facts: A series of short reports on over a dozen different products, shows how people's shopping choices - as well as government policy - can protect the environment, enhance social justice and improve health.\nsustain@sustainweb.org Sustain advocates food and agriculture policies and practices that enhance the health and welfare of people and animals, improve the working and living environment, promote equity and enrich society and

whole grains, nuts and seeds that are best when fresh and unprocessed.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".* High blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is less common among\u00a0vegans.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nDo carrots have a high or low water footprint?\nCarrots have a low water footprint.\nWhat is the water footprint of carrots?\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nDo carrots have a high or low carbon footprint?\nCarrots have a low carbon footprint.\nIt takes around 0.11 kg CO2e to produce 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds of carrots, a car driving equivalent of 0.25 miles or 0.5 kilometers, USA market data.\nFood not only has a water footprint but also a carbon footprint, known as CO2e, which stands for carbon dioxide equivalent.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nBe sure to buy Non-GMO\/organic, as toxic, chemical pesticides contaminate air, water, soil, etc.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nCarrots are a vegetable and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer

of beta carotene, fiber, vitamin K1, potassium, and antioxidants (1Trusted Source).\nThey\u2019re a weight-loss-friendly food and have been linked to lower cholesterol levels and improved eye health.\nOrange carrots get their bright color from beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body converts into vitamin A.\nCarrots contain very little fat and protein (3Trusted Source).\nEating low-glycemic foods is linked to numerous health benefits and considered particularly beneficial for people with diabetes (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nCarrots are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, especially biotin, potassium, and vitamins A (from beta carotene), K1 (phylloquinone), and B6.\nCarrots are an excellent source of vitamin A in the form of beta carotene.\nThese are substances with powerful antioxidant activity that have been linked to improved immune function and reduced risk of many illnesses, including heart disease, various degenerative ailments, and certain types of cancer (1Trusted Source).\nEating fat with carrots can help you absorb more of the beta carotene (19Trusted Source).\nCarrots are a great source of many plant compounds, especially carotenoids, such as beta carotene and lutein.\nWomen with high circulating levels of carotenoids may also have a reduced risk of breast cancer (30Trusted Source).\nIntake of carrots has been linked to lower cholesterol levels (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nAs a low-calorie food, carrots can increase fullness and decrease calorie intake in subsequent meals (33Trusted Source).\nIndividuals with low vitamin A levels are more likely to experience night blindness, a condition that may diminish by eating carrots or other foods rich in vitamin A or carotenoids (34Trusted Source).\nEating carrots is linked to a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease, as well as improved eye health.\nStudies comparing organic and conventionally grown carrots did not find any difference in the amount of carotenoids or antioxidant content and quality (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).\nThere\u2019s very little difference in nutrients between regular and baby carrots, and they should have the same health effects.\nAccording to one study, carrots can cause pollen-related allergic reactions in up to 25% of food-allergic individuals (44Trusted Source).\nCarrot allergy is an example of cross-reactivity in which the proteins in certain fruits or vegetables cause an allergic reaction because of their similarity to the proteins found in certain types of pollen.\nCarrots grown in contaminated soil or exposed to contaminated water may harbor larger amounts of heavy metals, which can affect their safety and quality (48Trusted Source).\nCarrots may cause reactions in people allergic to pollen.\nLearn about health benefits, risks, and food\u2026 From carrots to potatoes to onions, root vegetables have long been enjoyed as a delicious part of a healthy diet \u2014 and for good reason.\nHere are 13 of\u2026 People with diabetes can and should eat carrots as part of a healthy, balanced diet.","1":"Orange may be their

much beta-carotene, it can make your skin turn an orange-yellow color.\nToo much beta-carotene also may cause problems for people who can\u2019t change it to vitamin A, such as people who have hypothyroidism.","2":"Carrots also provide a good range of nutritional benefits for very few calories, and they taste great too.\nThis article examines some benefits of carrots and provides an in-depth guide to their nutritional values.\nHowever, many plant foods contain various carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, that can convert to retinol in the body.\nDue to their significant carotenoid content, carrots can provide an excellent source of vitamin A.\nOne large (72-gram) carrot contains more than 12,000 IU of carotenoids, equivalent to 601 mg of vitamin A retinol activity equivalent (5).\nCarrots are a good vegetable source of fiber, with a large carrot offering more than two grams of fiber.\nFirstly, carrots offer fiber, a good range of nutrients, and high water content for only 29 calories per large carrot (5).\nGenerally speaking, low-energy, nutrient-rich foods such as this tend to be good for promoting satiety.\nAs mentioned, these studies were only small, but they suggest that carrots may potentially play a beneficial role in satiety.\nCarrots have one of the highest carotenoid contents among all plant foods (17, 18).\nIn addition to their contribution to vitamin A intake, dietary carotenoids may have additional benefits.\nAccording to systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies, these potential benefits may include a lower risk of various chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome (19, 20, 21).\nOne of these systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined prospective studies examining how dietary intake and blood concentrations of carotenoids affected breast cancer risk.\nInterestingly, there was only a weak association between dietary intake and lower breast cancer risk when relying on food questionnaires.\nOn this note, purple carrots are thought to be a good dietary source of anthocyanins.\nAccording to several studies, the anthocyanin content of purple carrots ranges from 400 to 900 ppm compared to 800 to 3700 ppm in blueberries (25).\nFoods that contain anthocyanins are often referred to as \u201cheart-healthy\u201d due to observational data suggesting that these compounds may play a beneficial role in cardiovascular health.\nA recent systematic review and meta-analyses of observational studies suggested that anthocyanin intake may reduce cardiovascular disease mortality.\nIn the case of carrots, a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry analyzed various fresh and frozen carrot samples under storage conditions over several weeks.\nAlthough the nutritional values were comparable between fresh and frozen carrots for most micronutrients, there was a significant decrease in beta-carotene in the frozen carrot samples (30).\nThat said, the study suggests that frozen carrots might not provide as much beta-carotene as fresh carrots."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/carrots","1":"www.webmd.com\/food-recipes\/benefits-carrots","2":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/carrots-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
