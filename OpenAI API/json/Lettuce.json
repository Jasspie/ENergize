Again Salad Days found that the number of samples used for testing nitrate residues in lettuce was too low.\nFor example, in 1998, only 9 imported lettuces were tested for nitrate residues.\nIt is important to support sustainable lettuce production to ensure that lettuces remain a part of the diet.\nDr. Tim Lobstein, The Food Commission Food Facts: A series of short reports on over a dozen different products, shows how people's shopping choices - as well as government policy - can protect the environment, enhance social justice and improve health.\nsustain@sustainweb.org Sustain advocates food and agriculture policies and practices that enhance the health and welfare of people and animals, improve the working and living environment, promote equity and enrich society and culture.","1":"The issue is that the original Carnegie Mellon study on which the claim was based looked at energy, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions on a per calorie basis.\nAnd that\u2019s why comparing the environmental impact of different foods based on their calorie content can be a little misleading\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not as if people cutting 400 calories worth of bacon out of their diet are going to supplement that with 400 calories worth of lettuce (or approximately four heads of Romaine).\nIt set out to answer how shifting our current diets\u200a\u2014\u200awhich tend to be high in calories, red meats, and grains and low in fruits and vegetables\u200a\u2014\u200ato a USDA recommended diet, which is higher in fruits, vegetables, and meats like poultry and seafood, would impact energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use.\n\u201cFor the typical American, following those recommendations would mean eating more seafood and much, much more dairy, both of which have a larger environmental footprint.\u201d And that\u2019s basically what the Carnegie study confirmed, finding that the USDA recommended diet\u200a\u2014\u200awith its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and seafood\u200a\u2014\u200ahad higher emissions, energy use, and water use than current diets: farm energy increased by 38 percent, and greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent.\nIn bumping up the fruits and vegetables of an average diet to meet the USDA recommendations, Fischbeck and his colleague relied on consumers\u2019 current preferences for fruits and vegetables, prioritizing things that Americans tend to eat a lot of, like cucumbers, celery, bell peppers, and tomatoes\u200a\u2014\u200aall things that tend to be pretty low in calories.\nThe study did not look at how changing fruit and vegetable preferences to things that are both higher in calories and lower in emissions\u200a\u2014\u200aconvincing Americans to eat more cabbage or beans, instead of celery and tomatoes\u200a\u2014\u200awould impact the environment.\nWhat we\u2019re saying is that based on the preferences we have, those tend to be, on average, more intensive than the pork products.\u201d The study didn\u2019t look at a vegetarian diet\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a diet as recommended by the USDA, which includes eating less meat, but more seafood and dairy.\nThe Carnegie Mellon study isn\u2019t wrong\u200a\u2014\u200aif Americans were to reduce their meat consumption and supplement those lost calories with things like low-calorie fruits and vegetables or seafood and dairy, any decrease in emissions from reduced meat consumption could be offset by increased emissions elsewhere.\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that meat production\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially inefficient meat, like beef\u200a\u2014\u200ahas detrimental impacts on the environment; even the Carnegie Mellon study says that \u201cmeats and fish\/seafood have the highest average GHG emissions\u201d of any of the food groups looked at.\nThe answer isn\u2019t replacing all of the calories that we would get from meat with low-calorie options like lettuce or celery, or high-emissions alternatives like dairy and seafood.","2":"The investigation conducted by FDA, CDC, and state partners determined that consumption of romaine lettuce was the cause of the outbreak.\nTraceback of the romaine lettuce consumed by ill people determined that it originated in the Yuma produce growing region which consists of farms in Imperial County, California, and Yuma County, Arizona.\nThe traceback identified a total of 36 fields on 23 farms in the Yuma growing region as supplying romaine lettuce that was potentially contaminated and consumed during the outbreak.\nWith the exception of one instance where one of the legs of the traceback led to a single farm, it was not possible to determine which, or how many, of these farms shipped lettuce that was contaminated with the outbreak strain of E.\nThe epidemiological and traceback analyses performed during this outbreak informed an FDA-led Environmental Assessment (EA) of the Yuma produce growing region in collaboration with CDC and state partners from June through August 2018.\nThese three samples were collected in early June from a 3.5 mile stretch of an irrigation canal near Wellton in Yuma County that delivers water to farms in the local area, including several identified in the traceback as having potentially shipped romaine lettuce contaminated with the outbreak strain.\nThe EA was conducted over several visits by various members of a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in produce safety, agriculture, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, microbiology, environmental health, and sanitation from FDA and the CDC, with valuable contributions from the Arizona Department of Agriculture, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture.\nThe team relied upon the content of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule and Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) as the basis for assessing potential contributing factors that could have led to contamination of romaine lettuce on farms identified in the traceback.\nAreas of focus on these farms included but were not limited to: Similarly, the EA team and FDA investigators used FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Foods Rule and applicable guidance as the basis for assessing potential contributing factors that may have led to the contamination of romaine lettuce during manufacturing\/processing operations in FDA registered food facilities.\nAreas of focus for the manufacturing\/processing operations included but were not limited to: As part of the EA, the team conducted in-depth interviews with produce farm management and fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facility management during on-site visits.\nThe traceback investigation identified the locations visited, and the EA team collected information regarding relevant food safety procedures, policies, and practices.\nThe traceback indicates that the contaminated lettuce had to have been grown on multiple farms and processed at multiple off-farm fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facilities.\nHowever, the EA team still visited farms identified in the traceback as potentially shipping contaminated romaine lettuce that was consumed during the outbreak, where they made observations and, when appropriate, sampled those fields and adjacent areas.\nFDA also conducted a regulatory inspection and observed manufacturing\/processing of leafy greens at a fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facility identified via traceback investigation.\nThe EA team appreciates the cooperation of farms, fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facilities, cattle feeding operations, and water districts in the Yuma growing region that were contacted during this investigation.\nFDA and our partners at CDC identified 28 foodborne illness outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing E.\nSTEC contamination of leafy greens has been identified by traceback to most likely occur in the farm environment.\nContamination occurring in the farm environment may be amplified during fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing if appropriate preventive controls are not in place.\ncoli O157:H7, is not considered to be an environmental contaminant in fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing plants.\ncoli O157:H7 infections in humans occur from consuming contaminated food.\ncoli O157:H7 illnesses identified in the Yuma growing region prior to the time of the likely contamination event, therefore a human source for the outbreak is considered unlikely.\nThe outbreak strain was identified in three samples of water collected along a 3.5 mile stretch of an irrigation canal in the Wellton area of Yuma, County.\nFDA considers that the most likely way romaine lettuce became contaminated was from the use of water from this irrigation canal, since the outbreak strain of E.\nFDA cannot rule out that there are other sources or means of romaine lettuce contamination that were not identified during the EA investigation.\nInformation collected by the EA team indicates that, among the Yuma area farms identified in the traceback and that were interviewed, irrigation canal water was only directly applied during germination.\nHowever, aerial and ground-based spraying of crop protection pesticides diluted with irrigation canal water occurred at various times during the growing season on a number of these farms, including after a freeze event that occurred in late February.\nThe EA team did not identify an obvious route for contamination of the irrigation canal from this facility; in addition, the limited number of samples collected at the CAFO also did not yield the outbreak strain.\ncoli O157:H7 contamination of the romaine lettuce from some of the growing fields identified in the traceback could have been amplified by commingling cut romaine lettuce in wash systems at fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facilities.\nWashing of romaine lettuce either at a fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facility or at home by consumers may reduce but will not eliminate pathogens, including STEC, from romaine lettuce.\nThe commingling of romaine lettuce from various farm growing fields at fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facilities complicated traceback efforts and made it impossible for FDA to definitively determine which farm or farms identified in the traceback supplied romaine lettuce contaminated with the E.\nIn only one leg of the traceback involving whole head lettuce was FDA able to identify a single farm as having supplied contaminated lettuce.\nFDA was not able to conduct regulatory inspections and observe the manufacturing\/processing of leafy greens at all fresh-cut produce manufacturing\/processing facilities identified in the traceback investigation because many of these facilities were not in operation due to the end of the growing season and the manufacturing\/processing equipment that may have been used was no longer available for inspection.\nFDA has identified the following factors and findings as those that most likely contributed to the contamination of romaine lettuce from the Yuma growing region with E.\nThese factors demonstrate the importance of implementation of the FSMA Produce Safety Rule\u00a0provisions and GAPs on farms as well as the FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Foods Rule provisions, in manufacturing\/processing facilities and throughout the supply chain."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.sustainweb.org\/foodfacts\/salad_days\/","1":"archive.thinkprogress.org\/no-lettuce-is-not-worse-for-the-environment-than-bacon-e6c495e6abb0\/","2":"www.fda.gov\/food\/outbreaks-foodborne-illness\/environmental-assessment-factors-potentially-contributing-contamination-romaine-lettuce-implicated"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

lettuce in diet is known to prevent osteoporosis, iron-deficiency anemia, and believed to protect from cardiovascular diseases, ARMD, Alzheimer's disease and cancers.\nEach variety of lettuce features a unique keeping quality; hence, different methods should be applied while storing.\nWash Romaine and loose-leaf lettuces and drain any excess water before storing them in the refrigerator.\nRomaine will stay fresh for up to seven days whereas, butterhead and loose-leaf-types for two to three days.\nRegardless of the type, all lettuces should feature crispy, fresh leaves that are free of dark or slimy spots.\nVarieties such as romaine and butterhead should have compact heads with no brown stems.\nRaw, fresh lettuce commonly used in salads, burgers, spring rolls, and sandwiches.\nLettuce contains moderate levels of oxalic acid; 0.33 mg per 100 g of fresh leaves.\n<<-You may also like to read Stem-lettuce (Celtuce) nutrition facts.","2":"It is full of Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Fat,
