I keep a bag of nuts and dried fruit in my desk at work.\nPeanuts are much cheaper than tree nuts, but the amount of saturated fat gives me pause.\nI don\u2019t know anything about the impacts of growing some of the more exotic nuts, like Brazil nuts, cashews, and hazelnuts.\nA. Dearest Adrian, Grist thanks its sponsors.\nCrunchy, healthy nuts plus chewy, healthy dried fruit plus \u2026 oh, I believe you\u2019ve forgotten the most important ingredient in any trail mix: chocolate, of course!\nWe\u2019ve dealt quite a bit with almonds and their water requirements here at Grist, and walnuts and pistachios raise the same issues, so for now let\u2019s skip those.\nI\u2019m not going to tell you to stop eating them altogether \u2013 it\u2019s complicated, like most food issues \u2013 but it\u2019s good to consider their water footprints all the same.\nPeanuts are packed with healthy fats too, and their sat fat levels are on par with other nuts, like pecans, cashews, and walnuts.\n(Of course, peanuts are technically legumes \u2013 but let\u2019s not get too nutty with our sorting here.) And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation\u2019s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don\u2019t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou\u2019ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you\u2019re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to

Change and Health,\u201d researchers modeled the greenhouse gas emissions created during the life cycle of common American foods, from production and transport to retail, cooking, and waste disposal.\nWith that data, Stacker created the following gallery to illustrate the environmental impact of 20 common foods, ranked according to the carbon dioxide emitted in the full life cycle of 2.2 pounds\u00a0of said dish.\n2019's IPCC report singled out livestock for a reason\u2014but EWG\u2019s findings show that not all greenhouse-gas-intensive foods involve meat or dairy.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 2.0 lbs Unlike meat byproduct emissions, plant protein emissions typically occur after crops leave the farms where they are grown.\nFor lentils, post-farmgate emissions represent 59% of total emissions, much of which stems from the energy required to cook them, along with transport and waste disposal.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 4.2 lbs Meat isn\u2019t the only source of animal-linked emissions; dairy is also a culprit.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 4.4 lbs Emissions stemming from broccoli come from various sources, including transportation and waste, especially given the extent to which people tend to throw out stems.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 4.4 lbs Tofu\u2014or bean curd\u2014is sourced from soy milk, and the EWG report assesses tofu\u2019s carbon footprint based on conventional soybean processing.\nPost-farmgate emissions represent 65% of the total associated with dry beans, which inherently require energy use during cooking before consumption.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 4.9 lbs Like other dairy products, yogurt has a notable carbon footprint.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 5.1 lbs Nuts range considerably in terms of their carbon footprints.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 5.5 lbs Peanut butter is derived from one major ingredient\u2014peanuts\u2014with salt sometimes included.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 6.0 lbs While rice may be a lower source of carbon emissions than meat products, the staple is contributing to global warming in a big way.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 6.4 lbs Of all protein-rich plants, potatoes have the biggest carbon footprint, albeit with some major caveats.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 10.6 lbs Eggs are a major source of protein and contribute fewer emissions than meat.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 13.4 lbs The primary source of tuna\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (68%) is the diesel gas used to power fishing vessels.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 15.2 lbs A big advantage of chicken is that it has a smaller carbon footprint than other meat options.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 24.0 lbs This popular Thanksgiving staple is more emissions-intensive than chicken but otherwise very similar.\nThe meat is more sustainable than, say, beef or lamb, but still generates significant greenhouse gases thanks to energy-intensive practices of feeding, processing, and cooking.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 26.2 lbs Unlike free-swimming fish, farmed salmon require feed, electricity, and significant transportation, often between countries.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 26.7 lbs Pork\u2019s carbon footprint is indisputably high.\nPost-farmgate emissions from beef are a factor, including processing, transport, and cooking.\n- CO2 emitted during the life cycle of 2.2 lbs of this food: 86.4 lbs Beef may be under scrutiny, but lamb has the largest carbon footprint, according to

chips) can help lower levels of bad LDL cholesterol.\nSnacking on an ounce of nuts when hungry helps you feel full, making it easier to avoid high-carb foods and keep blood sugars in check.\nPecans have a very low glycemic index, which means that eating them does not cause a spike in blood sugar, even in people with diabetes.\nThe magnesium, calcium, fiber, vitamin E, and zinc in pecans also give the nuts anti-inflammatory properties.\nPecans are rich in many vitamins and minerals important for healthy skin, eyes, teeth, bones, muscles, and nerves.\nPecans are a great source of healthy fats but are high in calories, so it is important to watch your portion sizes.\nWhen you find yourself craving a crunchy snack, reach for a handful of pecans instead of potato chips.\nAmerican Heart

takes a full look at the nutrition profile of pecans as well as the benefits that they provide.\nNutritionally, pecans are predominantly a source of fat, but they also provide smaller amounts of carbohydrate and protein.\nHere we can see the full nutritional values for pecans, including the calories, macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals.\nTheir overall vitamin-density is not high, but pecans are a significant source of minerals.\nThis mineral profile is somewhat similar to the nutritional values of pine nuts.\nThe most abundant mineral in pecan nuts is manganese, and this nutrient is vital for maintaining healthy bones, optimal skeletal health, and wound healing (11).\nAlthough we do not fully understand how they work at this point, numerous randomized clinical trials have shown benefits from a high-flavonoid intake.\nA recent review paper showed how this compound is likely responsible for many of the health benefits pecans demonstrate in clinical trials (16).\nFirstly, it is important to note that no single food can singlehandedly control blood sugar and insulin levels.\nOver the past two years, two interesting trials examined the effect of pecans on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, specifically focusing on blood glucose and insulin levels.\nInterestingly, after four weeks of following the pecan plan, key markers of cardiovascular risk such as blood glucose levels and insulin resistance improved compared to the control diet (17).\nIn a 12-week study, 15% of calories from pecans per day improved cardiovascular risk compared to an eating plan based on the average American diet (18).\nEither way, compared to a standard American diet, a diet that includes a high intake of pecans improved the cardiovascular risk profile.\nFor a similar reason, pecans are a suitable snack for people with diabetes trying to control their blood glucose levels (19).\nFiber also slows digestion, and studies demonstrate that it can reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.\nAs a result, a higher fiber intake will help to reduce the blood glucose response from meals higher in carbohydrate (20).\nAs just mentioned, pecans are suitable food for anyone trying to control their blood sugar levels.\nA recent study looked into this issue, and when nuts replace dietary carbohydrate, the results appear to be positive.\nOverall, the results demonstrated that replacing carbohydrate with nuts improved glycemic response and lowered HbA1c levels.\nFurthermore, as previously discussed, diets including a high daily intake of pecans lead to better blood glucose levels than standard American diets (17).\nAlthough it is not a significant amount compared to other foods, pecans also provide a source of protein.\nOverall, pecans offer a good nutrient profile, more polyphenols than any other nut, and they may help to improve blood glucose levels.","2":"Just a single ounce of pecans (about 19 halves) is 200 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 20 grams of mostly unsaturated fats, making it a hearty, satisfying snack with loads of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.\nWhat's more, eating ellagic acid-containing foods \u2014 an antioxidant found in pecans \u2014 is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers.\nAnother benefit to these tasty tree nuts: Pecans are filled with beta carotene and vitamin E, which protect cells from damage by mitigating the effects of chronic inflammation.\nIt may not be news to you that nuts are some of the most nutritious foods, but chew on this: Diets high in vitamin E have been linked with lowering risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia by up to 25%.\nThat's because vitamin E and other antioxidants in plant-based foods help reduce oxidative stress caused by inflammation, protecting cells and therefore tissues of vital organs like your brain.\nThat's because nuts are a filling source of oleic acid, a better-for-you fat that makes you feel full while also boosting heart health.\nEating every three to four hours, limiting added sugars and saturated fats found in processed foods, and making more of your meals plant-based are also key to successful, long-term weight loss.\nPecans are excellent sources of manganese and copper, two minerals that boost overall metabolic health, may contain anti-inflammatory properties, and potentially help reduce risk of heart disease.\nDiets high in sodium have been linked to increased risk of chronic disease, especially high blood pressure."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-pecans","1":"www.nutritionadvance.com\/pecan-nutrition-benefits\/","2":"www.goodhousekeeping.com\/health\/diet-nutrition\/a47166\/health-benefits-of-pecans\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
