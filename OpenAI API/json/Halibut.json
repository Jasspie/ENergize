to improve the fishery and ensure sustainable resource management.\nAll food production has an impact on the environment and studies have shown that wild seafood production produces relatively low greenhouse gas emissions.\nSPATIAL FOOTPRINT OF FISHING:The wild Pacific halibut fishery takes place in less than 0.7% of Canada\u2019s Pacific marine area.","1":"Although populations are well below target levels, U.S. wild-caught Atlantic halibut is still a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed under a rebuilding plan that allows limited harvest by U.S. fishermen.\nTrawl gear

12 other species of groundfish.","2":"A flounderlike flatfish, Pacific halibut is an ocean-bottom dweller, moving from shore to more open seas as it matures.\nPacific halibut grow from 4 to 7 feet

have moderate levels of incidentally-caught finfish, many of which are landed, and gillnets have high levels of bycatch of birds and marine mammals, some of which are protected species.\nAlthough Greenland turbot populations are not considered depleted, it is rated Eco-Ok due to concerns regarding bycatch and potential habitat impacts from bottom trawling.\nA flounderlike flatfish, the Atlantic halibut lives along the ocean bottom in varied depths of water.\nBecause this fish grows slowly (reaching 7-9 feet, or 2.1-2.7 meters, and living as long as 50 years), it matures late and is vulnerable to overfishing.\nAtlantic halibut populations are depleted and commercial harvest of this fish is prohibited in the United States.\nAtlantic halibut come from marine fisheries, not fish

potential risks, such as mercury contamination and sustainability.\nThis article evaluates the nutritional benefits and potential risks of eating halibut.\nHalibut is an excellent source of selenium, a trace mineral with many health benefits that your body needs in small amounts.\nOne half-filet (160 grams) of halibut can provide more than a third of your dietary needs for multiple vitamins and minerals, including selenium, niacin, phosphorus, magnesium and vitamins B12 and B6.\nOne serving of cooked halibut packs 42 grams of high-quality protein and thus can help meet your dietary protein needs (1).\nProtein plays a variety of important roles in your body, including building and repairing muscle or suppressing appetite.\nHalibut contains a variety of nutrients that are good for your heart, such as omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, selenium and magnesium.\nA half-filet of halibut provides about 1.1 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (1, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).\nOmega-3 fatty acids have numerous heart health benefits (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29).\nIn addition, the high selenium content in halibut helps decrease your risk of heart disease by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and the buildup of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol in your arteries (2Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nHalibut provides a variety of nutrients that may improve your heart health and help fight heart disease.\nHalibut\u2019s selenium, niacin and omega-3 contents can help reduce the negative effects of chronic inflammation.\nStudies have shown that increased selenium blood levels improve your immune response, whereas a deficiency may negatively affect immune cells and their function (40Trusted Source).\nOmega-3 fatty acids and niacin also play a role in reducing inflammation.\nWhat\u2019s more, studies have shown a consistent link between omega-3 fatty acid intake and decreased levels of inflammation.\nThe selenium, niacin and omega-3 contents in halibut can help fight chronic inflammation that contributes to poor health.\nFrom nutrition to sustainability to contamination, there are a lot of things to consider when comparing wild-caught and farm-raised fish \u2014 each have their pros and cons (48Trusted Source).\nIn an effort to keep wild fish populations from being overfished, Atlantic halibut is farmed in Canada, Iceland, Norway and the UK.\nOne benefit of farm-raised fish is that they\u2019re typically less expensive and more readily available to consumers than wild-caught fish (50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source).\nThe minor nutritional differences between wild-caught and farm-raised halibut are not enough to proclaim one healthier than the other.\nThere are pros and cons to both wild-caught and farm-raised halibut.\nFor most people, the mercury levels consumed by eating recommended amounts of fish and shellfish is not a major concern.\nWhat\u2019s more, benefits of eating moderate amounts of fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like halibut, may outweigh the risk.\nHalibut fish tends to be low to moderate in mercury content and is considered safe to eat in moderate amounts (58).\nTherefore, it\u2019s considered safe for those who are healthy and not at risk of certain kidney diseases (61Trusted Source).\nSustainability is a concern with the increased demand for wild-caught fish (62Trusted Source).\nOne way to sustain wild fish populations is to increase the availability of farmed fish.\nThere are some low to moderate concerns of consuming halibut, such as mercury and purine levels or sustainability.\nThough it\u2019s low to moderate in mercury and purines, halibut\u2019s nutrition benefits outweigh potential safety concerns.\nIt\u2019s rich in protein, omega-3 fatty

halibut to your diet can come with significant advantages for health.\nBecause selenium helps reduce inflammation, experts have suggested that it could help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
