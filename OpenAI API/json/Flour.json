buy Non-GMO\/organic, as toxic, chemical pesticides contaminate air, water, soil, etc.\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nBuying seasonally reduces carbon emissions from hothouses (greenhouses).\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nFlour is made from ground raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nDucks:\u00a0An estimated 11 million ducks are killed for food every day worldwide.\nPigs: An estimated 4 million pigs are killed for food

are killed for food around the world every day.\nCows: An estimated 800,000 cows are killed for food around the world every day.\nThe meat, poultry and dairy industries do everything they can to distance us from knowing how our food comes to be in order to keep us in the dark about what we support each time we buy animal derived products and byproducts.\nWe can improve people\u2019s lives with foods we eat every day simply by buying products that are certified fair

that you choose to use.\nLearn how to make your food more healthy with different types of flour.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for 1 cup (125g) of all-purpose white flour.1\ufeff There are many different types of flour that can be used for cooking or baking.\nOne of the common types of flour is all-purpose white flour made from wheat.\nIt is also a good source of copper, iron, phosphorus, and zinc.2\ufeff But there are many different varieties\u00a0of flour that you might choose to bake or prepare foods.\nIt's helpful to compare common uses and nutrition facts for different types of flour and to decide which one is right for you.\nYou might choose to use a different type of flour to bake with in order to improve the health benefits of your food.\nFor example, bread made from whole wheat flour provides better nutrition than bread made from refined grains.\nWheat flour has a shorter shelf life than other flours, so it won't last as long; store in the freezer for best results.\nShould I always use whole grain flour for better health?Not necessarily.\nIf you are a baker, you may be able to choose the type of flour you use in recipes.\nWhile it's smart to look for ingredients like whole wheat flour, you should also make smart nutritional decisions based on other ingredients in your food.\nWheat flour, white, all-purpose, enriched, bleached.\nTypes of Wheat Flour.","1":"Fiber is an important part of the diet because it prevents constipation, helps control blood sugar levels, protects against heart disease and even helps in weight loss.\nIt also contains more iron, calcium, protein and other nutrients than many other types of flour, and is a source of beta-glucans and other beneficial substances.\n[4] Wheat bran is very rich in insoluble fiber, which has beneficial effects on the human body.\n[2] [4] Use of wheat flour \u2013 most often used for the production of bread, pasta, pastries, cakes and biscuits.\nIn combination with the high content of fiber that spelt flour can be proud of, it helps to slow down digestion and induces a feeling of satiety.\nIn addition, high fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nThe fiber content of spelt flour is in fact slightly lower than that of wheat flour, but they contain a similar amount of soluble fiber.\n[5] [6] [7] Since spelt generally contains high levels of minerals and vitamins, it can, for example, improve the immune system, lower blood sugar levels, as well as help with bad LDL cholesterol levels.\n[5] [6] [7] Use of spelt flour \u2013 just like wheat flour, it is most often used for the production of bread, pasta, pastries, cakes and biscuits or pancakes.\n[9] [10] Rye flour can improve several aspects of heart health, as some research links its intake to lower risk factors for heart disease.\nFor example, an 8-week study compared the effects of eating rye and wheat flour on blood cholesterol levels.\n[11] The researchers found that rye flour was 14% more effective than wheat flour in reducing bad LDL cholesterol.\n[9] [10] As rye flour is rich in fiber, it effectively contributes to the improvement of the digestive tract, as it absorbs water, and thus helps to improve the permeability of the intestines.\nSome studies even suggest that rye flour was more effective in treating constipation than wheat flour.\nOther studies have also found that fiber from rye flour can increase the level of short-chain fatty acids.\nThese acids have been linked to various benefits, including weight loss, lower blood sugar and protection against colon cancer.\n[9] [10] [11] Use of rye flour\u00a0\u2013 most often used for bread production or yeasting.\nIt is similar to wheat flour, except that it is gluten-free and has a higher protein content than other common flours.\n[12] Oats generally contain large amounts of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that forms a coarse, gel solution in the intestine, causing a feeling of satiety.\nThe main health benefits of beta-glucans include: Oats, and therefore oat flour, are high in antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds called polyphenols.\n[12] [14] [15] Use of oat flour \u2013 can be used to prepare all gluten-free dishes \u2013 cakes, biscuits, pancakes, etc.\nCoconut flour has a relatively high content of protein, fiber and fat and a relatively low content of carbohydrates compared to other flours.\n[16] Coconut flour can help with weight loss, as it contains medium chain triglycerides (MCT).\nIn fact, studies have linked buckwheat intake to lower blood sugar levels in people with the disease.\n[20] [21] Buckwheat flour boasts with many compounds that are beneficial to heart health, such as rutin, magnesium, copper, fiber and certain proteins.\nAmong cereals and pseudocereals, buckwheat is the richest source of rutin, an antioxidant that can, for example, reduce the risk of heart disease by preventing the formation of blood clots and lowering inflammation or blood pressure.\n[20] [22] [23] Use of buckwheat flour \u2013 can be used for baking and cooking or thickening food.\n[24] Rice flour contains choline, which helps transport cholesterol and triglycerides from the liver to places where the body lacks it.\n[26] [27] Green bananas are known to be rich in prebiotic fiber, which is important for promoting intestinal health as well as reducing belly fat.\nPrebiotic fiber also improves digestion and is abundant in banana flour.\n[26] [27] Banana flour is extremely rich in resistant starch, so it can help diabetics improve insulin sensitivity and maintain blood sugar levels.\n[28] [29] [30] Use of tapioca flour \u2013 used mainly for thickening food.\nAlmond flour is extremely rich in healthy fats, proteins and vitamin E, which acts as an antioxidant.\n[31] [32] Foods made from wheat are high in carbohydrates, low in fat and fiber.\nAlmond flour, on the other hand, is low in carbohydrates but high in healthy fats and fiber.\nIn addition, almond flour is also rich in magnesium, which is involved in improving blood sugar control, reducing insulin resistance and blood pressure.\n[31] [33] An analysis of five studies found that those who ate almond flour meals had a decrease in LDL cholesterol of 5.79 mg compared to those who ate wheat flour meals.\n[31] [34] [35] Use of almond flour \u2013 most often used as a substitute for wheat flour in baking cakes, pancakes and desserts.\nAs a result, flaxseed flour is also a source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which our body cannot make, so we must intake it from the diet.\n\u2013 https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/what-is-spelt [6] Joanne Slavin - Fiber and Prebiotics:
