greenhouse gas emissions, it would be better if we were to substitute animal products wherever possible with crop-based proteins such as lentils and chickpeas.\nIt examined what emissions reductions might be achievable if our diets switched from a largely meat-based diet to one in which substitute proteins such as tofu and chick peas were far more prominent.\n\"Our analysis shows that direct substitution of livestock products in the diet with analogue high protein products based on for example soy involves increased dependence on imported crop commodities.\nModern diets have protein in excess and substitution through a general increase in crop products [such as lentils and chick peas] is a more effective and sustainable strategy.\" Looks like the hippies were right after all.\nSo, the substitution of beef and sheep meat with Quorn, tofu and pulses clearly demands more overseas land.\nWere higher yielding pulses used, this demand would clearly be reduced.\" As vegetarians and vegans have long realised, a meat-free diet can often mean relying heavily on foods imported from abroad.\nBut the report does seem to conclude that, even knowing that meat substitutes such as tofu and Quorn are a less efficient option than lentils and chickpeas, it is still worth pursuing a meat-free diet if emissions reductions are our goal: Diet provides single [emissions reduction] measures with big effects.\nThe benefit of a vegetarian diet increases to about 38% when our estimates of LUC [land use change] emissions are included, but this excludes the loss of soil carbon if UK grassland was converted to arable cropping.\nOur analysis of the effects of the production of substitutes leads to the conclusion that a broad reduction in livestock product consumption balanced by broad-based increases in crop product intake [such as lentils and chick peas] is a more feasible measure which avoids the land use burden associated with soy based livestock product analogues.\nRemoving meat from the diet and replacing it with plant foods with similar protein contents reduces the carbon footprint of diet by one fifth.\nIf food plays a full part in moving to a low carbon economy, these reductions meat and dairy products need to be combined with other measures, including improvements to farming.\nThis argument is all about relative impacts, and there does seem to be growing evidence \u2013 including a study last week by WWF and Cranfield University \u2013 that soy-based proteins such as tofu can have a far larger impact on the environment than we might have otherwise imagined.","1":"The story came from a talk given by Dr. Graham McAuliffe of the Rothamsted Institute, who spoke at the National Farmers Union this week explaining that his unpublished research on tofu suggests that it could have a more drastic impact on the planet than beef, pork, and chicken.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, peas and groundnuts always have a lower environmental impact than any livestock products,\u201d said McAuliffe, \u201cBut if you look at tofu, which is processed so there is more energy going into its production, when you correct for the fact that the protein in it is not as digestible compared to the meat-based products, you can see that it could actually have a higher global warming potential than any of the monogastric animals.\u201d Monogastric animals only have one stomach (the clue is in the name) like us, horses, rabbits, rats, dogs, and pigs.\nPoore\u2019s study, which attracted much praise from fellow scientists, shows how catastrophic the environmental impact of meat and dairy foods are compared to plant foods \u2013 including tofu \u2013 see Poore\u2019s graph here or the BBC\u2019s simple diagram here.\nTofu is a traditional food made by coagulating soya milk and pressing the curds into a block \u2013 a very similar process is used to make cheese in fact; so does the NFU say cheese is a processed food to be avoided for the sake of the environment?\nTofu is a low-fat great source of protein and should not be considered an ultra-processed food.\nTargeting tofu as an environmental villain is ludicrous given that so much of the devastating deforestation in the Amazon is being done to grow soya for animal feed so that people can eat meat.\nIf you care about the environment, you should ditch meat and eat more tofu!","2":"A longtime staple of vegetarian diets \u2013 and of course, Thai and Chinese cooking \u2013 tofu is now sparking debate as the world wakes up to the environmental impact of their food.\nSpeaking at the National Farmers Union conference in London, Dr Graham McAuliffe from the Rothamsted Institute referenced yet to be published research that suggests tofu may have a bigger impact on climate change than some meats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that the vast majority of foods, plant-based or not, are going to have an impact on the environment.\nEver-growing lists of reports have suggested eating less meat is key to reducing our environmental impact on the planet, with the United Nations, the University of Oxford and the Government\u2019s own Committee on Climate Change coming to this conclusion.\n\u201cMore than 25% of global emissions come from food, and over half of this comes from animal products,\u201d Andrew Stephen, CEO of the Sustainable Restaurant Association, tells HuffPost UK.\nBut a major contributor to the environmental cost of meat is the food the animals themselves consume, which regularly includes soybean animal feed.\nTofu is made by curdling soya milk taken from soybeans, which is why some critics argue that it\u2019s not a sustainable alternative to meat.\n\u201cMany involved in the meat industry would like to blame tofu for soya demand and deforestation, but the reality is that the vast majority of soya production is still used to feed farmed animals,\u201d says Turner.\n\u201cReports from groups such as the Environmental Working Group have illustrated that the greenhouse gas emissions created by 1kg of tofu are far less than that of meats.\u201d The main reason for confusion around tofu\u2019s eco-credentials compared to meat is because production methods and supply chains for both vary a lot, says Stephen.\nUncertified South American soy can come with a heavy environmental cost.\u201d For now, most soya in the world is consumed by livestock.\n\u201cWhile there are better plant-based options for the environment than tofu, eating a vegan diet is still the best thing you can do to reduce your environmental footprint,\u201d says Turner."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.theguardian.com\/environment\/green-living-blog\/2010\/feb\/15\/ask-leo-tofu-bad-for-environment","1":"plantbasednews.org\/opinion\/study-claiming-tofu-bad-environment\/","2":"www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/entry\/tofu-impact-environment_uk_5e43f90fc5b61b84d3430fb5"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

determined by the firmness and water content.\nThe more firm, the less water content, and therefore, the more calories and nutrients.\nThe more liquid varieties, like silken and soft tofu, have more water in it, and fewer calories, carbs, protein, and fat.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for a one-quarter cup (or 81 grams) of firm tofu.1\ufeff Tofu is a low carbohydrate food.\nA typical\u00a0serving of firm tofu is 1\/5 of a package or 79 grams.\nThis contains around 2 grams of\u00a0carbohydrates and 2 grams of fiber.1\ufeff Although one serving of firm tofu contains around 7 grams of fat, most of the fat is\u00a0heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats and to a lesser degree monounsaturated fat.2\ufeff Tofu is an excellent source of protein, with 14 grams per serving.\nSince tofu is a complete protein (which means it contains 9 of the essential amino acids required by the diet) it can be used as a substitute in recipes that call for meat.\nMany people who don't eat meat use tofu as the\u00a0main protein in a meal.\nThe link to osteoporosis prevention requires more long-term studies comparing isoflavone by itself to soy products as a whole because protein also contributes to bone health.6 The National Institutes of Health suggests that soy is safe for most people when used as a food or taken for a short time as a dietary supplement.\nThey recommend that\u00a0women who are at risk for breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive conditions should discuss soy-containing dietary supplements with their health care\u00a0providers before consuming them.7 Soy, the main ingredient in tofu, is one of the top food allergens in children and adults.\nPeople allergic to wheat, beans (legumes), milk or other food can have also have an allergic reaction to soy.\nCertain depression medications (MAOIs) may interact with fermented soy products due to their potentially high level of the amino acid tyramine.\nOne serving of firm tofu can contain between less than 1 mg to close to 5 mg, depending on how long it has been fermenting.\nPeople taking the blood thinner warfarin should use also avoid soy products because it affects the efficacy of the medication.\nTofu comes in four varieties, based on the water content.\nThe more firm, the less water, and the more calories and nutrients per serving.\nBefore preparing tofu, open the package, and drain the product.\nTofu, raw, firm, prepared with calcium sulphate.\nSoy and Health Update: Evaluation of the Clinical and Epidemiologic Literature.\nSoy Foods And Their Protein and

published in 2019 by Grand View Research \"Tofu is a fabulous plant protein option for everyone,\" says Desiree Nielsen, RD, author of Eat More Plants: Over 100 Anti-Inflammatory, Plant-Based Recipes for Vibrant Living.\nA 1.2 cup serving of tofu contains: Total fat: 5.9 g (9 percent DV) Saturated fat: 0.9 g (4 percent DV) Carbohydrate: 2.3 g (1 percent DV) Dietary fiber: 0.4 (1 percent DV) Sodium: 8.7 mg (0 percent DV) \"Soy foods like tofu are unique in that they have the highest protein quality among plant proteins,\" says Sharon Palmer, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist specializing in plant-based nutrition and sustainable living.\n\"Just like meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy, tofu contains good amounts of all the amino acids your body needs to manufacture its own protein supply.\" \"Isoflavones are another word for the antioxidants in soy,\" says Ginger Hultin, RDN, a Seattle-based registered dietitian nutritionist.\n\"These compounds may decrease inflammation and are likely responsible for many of soy's health benefits.\" \"Depending on the type of coagulant used to set the tofu, it may contain as much as 30 percent of the RDA for calcium,\" says Alex Caspero, RD, a registered dietitian and plant-based chef in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\"There's a reason the American Heart Association recommends consuming soy foods like tofu,\" says Caspero.\n\"Soy can reduce both total and 'bad' LDL cholesterol.\" A 2020 Circulation study of 289,900 people found that women who consumed one or more servings of tofu per week were 18 percent less likely to develop coronary heart disease than those who ate tofu less than once a month.\n(Here are even more foods that help lower cholesterol.) \"There's this common misconception that tofu is high in estrogen, a hormone that may fuel the growth of certain kinds of breast cancer,\" says Nielsen.\n\"Soy foods contain naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as isoflavones, which have more of a balancing effect on the body's hormone levels,\" she explains.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, soy foods like tofu may actually help guard against breast cancer, but there's not enough evidence to say for sure.\nAfter reviewing the results of 14 studies, researchers found that women who consumed the most tofu were 22 percent less likely to develop breast cancer than those who ate the least tofu.\n(Learn about these other soy myths.)  \"Research confirms that tofu is safe to eat at all stages of life,\" says Nielsen.\n\"But it's not a miracle food.\" For example, research on tofu's ability to alleviate menopausal symptoms, like hot flashes, is still inconclusive, she says.\nContrary to the rumors, tofu won't slow your thyroid, says Caspero.\n\"Tofu is like a blank canvas,\" says Palmer.\n\"I typically use pressed or extra-firm tofu in my recipes for its dense texture,\" says Nielsen.\n\"If you can cook chicken, you already know how to cook tofu,\" says Nielsen.\n\"It needs to be well-seasoned and spiced, but even a simple pan-fry will create a texture that most people will love.\" Another trick for great-tasting tofu is pressing it.\n\"Tofu is packed in water, so you want to make sure to get as much of that water out as possible for the best texture,\" says Caspero.\n\"Simply wrap it in a few kitchen towels then press a heavy object on top, like a cast-iron skillet or some cans.\" (Or, if you're feeling fancy, you can invest in a tofu press.)  Eating leaner cuts of meats can cut your LDLs because you\u2019re getting less cholesterol-raising saturated fat in every bite.\nBoth fruits are rich in pectin, another soluble fiber that helps lower LDLs. Other great pectin sources include apples and all types of berries.\nResearchers have found that this reduced LDL levels by 30 percent in people with type 2 diabetes."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"lightlife.com","1":"www.verywellfit.com\/tofu-nutrition-facts-calories-and-health-benefits-4113988","2":"www.msn.com\/en-us\/health\/nutrition\/8-tofu-health-benefits-you-should-know\/ar-BB1dJ6RY"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 90","1":" 90","2":" 70"}}
