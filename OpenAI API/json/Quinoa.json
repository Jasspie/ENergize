and improving your environmental impact.\nWhile we are certainly no experts on that, we wanted to take a closer look at the environmental footprint of Quinoa.\nWhile the inputs are the components that go into the actual product, the outputs can be more diverse: They can be in form of the actual product (the Quinoa), emissions to water, soil or air (that could be CO\u2082), or waste.\nIn the case of our Quinoa, the inputs come from nature (Carbon dioxide, Energy, Water) and from man-made sources (\u201cInputs from the technosphere\u201d).\nThe data from Kellogg\u2019s also came with quantities that we can use to calculate the impact of 1 kg of Quinoa.\nEcoinvent is the world\u2019s biggest database for life cycle inventory data \u2013 and with hundreds of thousands of datasets, it\u2019s the perfect starting point to calculate any environmental footprint.\nCombined with our own LCA algorithms, Ecoinvent allows us to calculate environmental footprints of pretty much any product, fast.\nThe total impact of 1kg of Quinoa is, in this case, 1,48kg of CO\u2082.\nThe impact comes, exclusively, from man-made resources, with the biggest driver being the machinery used to produce the product.\nThis is because they are emissions to the soil \u2013 they have no impact on air pollution, which is what is measured with CO\u2082.\nIf we would analyze the Quinoa with a more holistic indicator, like the Environmental Cost Indicator, these emissions could have quite a significant impact.\nLuckily, we can rely on some research data for the environmental footprint of rice.\nOur Quinoa accounts for 1,48 kg CO\u2082 per kg.\nThey should never be generalized \u2013 and if you happen to sell Quinoa (or any other product), you should get in touch so we can help you measure your footprint, too.","1":"It might be hard to believe, but there was once a time when most of the American public didn\u2019t know what quinoa was, much less how to pronounce it (by the way, it\u2019s pronounced keen-wa, for anyone still in the dark).\nIn recent years, human rights activists have raised concerns over whether the seed\u2019s booming sales have adversely affected the Bolivian and Peruvian farmers that rely on quinoa as a staple in their own diets.\nAs a result of its popularity, the price of quinoa has skyrocketed in the countries where it is grown, and farmers are scrambling to grow enough to meet the demand.\nThe resulting production methods, besides causing increased poverty in these communities, have also had a strong effect on biodiversity and the environment.\nIn some ways, it\u2019s quite simple: an increasing public demand for quinoa has led to a need for farmers to expand their lands to cultivate the protein-rich seed.\nHowever, as consumption has increased, farmers have expanded its area of cultivation, forcing out other crops grown in the region.\nIn Bolivia, quinoa production increased by 40 times from 2000 to 2009.\nNot only does quinoa grow at very high altitudes, but it relies on the natural manure produced by llamas in the region.\nAs farmers have expanded on more land, they have displaced llamas who traditionally provided natural fertilizer and prevented erosion, which has caused farmers to replace the manure.\nAnother concern relates to the increased incidence of insects where quinoa is grown.\nFinally, consider that with an increasing consumer demand, farmers can no longer harvest their crops by hand.\nQuinoa is a somewhat unique case, because, unlike other monoculture foods, which can be obtained locally or grown in your own background, this plant needs a very specific altitude and environment in which to thrive.\nThe main crop \"pushed out of production\" in the past 5 years has been coca.\nContrary to your claim that llamas provide the main source of fertilizer for these areas, guano is used far more.\nAlso, your claim that more insecticides are used is true, but it is in no way correlated to an increase in quinoa production.\nYou seem to applaud the hand work performed by farmers, but it is one of the main causes of poverty and subsistence agriculture.","2":"This pseudo-cereal superfood stirs up debate \u2013 packed with nutrition and the potential to improve global food security \u2013 quinoa is shrouded in humanitarian and environmental issues.\nQuinoa was one of the grains that the government purchased from small farmers as part of this program.\nMore farmers began to expand their crop size and produce quinoa for government purchase when the \u2018quinoa boom\u2019 hit in 2009.\nThey claimed that the high quinoa prices, brought on by the boom, made it impossible for Andean farmers to afford it.\nThis meant modest farm families who once enjoyed a vitamin and mineral-rich superfood would now suffer from food insecurity.\nThere were rumors of land conflicts and loss of biodiversity as farmers turned to monocropping and abandoned traditional, sustainable farming practices to keep up with increased demand.\nWell-intentioned consumers concerned for Andean people and the environment slowed or stopped their quinoa consumption, dropping farmers\u2019 sale prices from $4 per pound back to $0.60.\nThe claims being made were based on studies from Bolivia, not Peru, even though Peru is responsible for roughly 60% of global quinoa production and exportation.\nAgricultural economist Andrew Stevens, also studied the ENAHO survey and found that quinoa is simply one in 161 foods that make up many Peruvians\u2019 diets.\nThe media scare that led to the quinoa bust got one thing right: The quinoa boom had negative effects on Peruvian farmlands and the environment.\nFarmers trying to keep up with demand and make more profit abandoned tradition.\nIndustrial harvesting and post-harvesting technologies have been introduced, reducing the use of sustainable, small-scale production.\nBecause quinoa production had not been a largely produced crop before the boom, quinoa-specific machinery had not been developed yet.\nCompanies, wanting to automate their processes, began to use technologies adapted from other crops, which led to problems with waste and inefficiency.\nThese solutions, although not as sustainable as traditional methods, reduce energy loss and greatly reduce harmful by-products.\nWalsh-Dilley, in her study on a community in Bolivia, notes a hopeful return to traditional practices, stating that producers in the area are abandoning tractors and returning to hand labor after seeing the negative consequences of automation on the land; land degradation and poor quality soil.\nMonocropping single-variety quinoa makes the crop more susceptible to pests and as a result, farmers are using more pesticides.\nAnd because quinoa farming has expanded, quinoa is being grown outside of its traditional areas where the crop is more vulnerable to disease and fungus.\nIt\u2019s crucial that the government incentivize the use of traditional and responsible farming practices before production capacity drops to extremes.\nPart of what makes quinoa a future source for global food security lies in its diversity.\nHowever, due to the Global North\u2019s preference for light-colored, large grains, farmers are demonstrating a tendency to produce much less variety.\nFurther, llamas often invade quinoa fields and destroy crops as a result of decreased territory and this, too, causes tension between farmers.\nMany llama farmers have abandoned llama farming and have turned to the more profitable quinoa production.\nThis has resulted in a decreased llama population; another example of biodiversity that\u2019s at risk as a result of abandoning sustainable practices.\nThe argument is that Andean farmers need protection from unbalanced competition if developed countries, like the U.S., begin to cultivate and sell their own quinoa crops worldwide.\nIn fact, small farmers need protection from big business, not only abroad, but in their own countries.\nThe quinoa bust left small farmers without the financial means to compete in today\u2019s market.\nLarge-scale Andean producers have the technology, capital and credit to increase yields and monopolize the market.\nWithout these traditions, the hope for quinoa as a sustainable food product could be lost.\nQuinoa has a lot of potential as a sustainable crop with the ability to make food more secure for vulnerable regions around the world.\nIncluding a high content of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and zinc.\u201d As you can see from the nutrition facts, quinoa is a source of vitamins like riboflavin and folic acid.\nThe FAO of the UN has high hopes for using quinoa to aid its efforts to reduce global hunger and secure food for all.\nIn fact, the environment in Altiplano, Peru produces quinoa despite its harsh conditions like those listed above.\nAdditionally, quinoa can be produced at low costs and can offer poverty-stricken communities high nutritional value to fight malnutrition.\nA repeating theme in this article is that for quinoa to be sustainable, farmers, governments, cooperatives and quinoa companies must embrace traditional farming practices that respect crop rotation, biodiversity, land held in common and \u2018rest\u2019 periods for the land.\nWe know quinoa has the potential to be farmed sustainably because it already has been, and many small farmers continue to do so.\nProtein-rich plant foods like quinoa help us get the nutrition we need and reduce our meat consumption at the same time.\n\u201cTherefore, quinoa saponin may be usedas an environmentally friendly alternative for protection of rice cultures against GAS.\u201d According to Peruvian government figures, almost 40% of quinoa farmers are women who are usually inflexible to take other jobs because of their role as caregivers for children and the elderly.\nUndoubtedly, there\u2019s a need for more research and resources to promote and maintain sustainable farming practices, while involving small farmers to avoid shutting them out of premium market prices.\nSmall farmers can form cooperatives and differentiate their quinoa as fair-trade and organic to compete with large farms.\nAlthough the quinoa boom did not come without its negative environmental and socio-economic side effects, this seedy grain superfood has the potential to not only reach sustainability status but also help those affected by climate change, in a sustainable way.\nIn fact, many small farmers in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador are already producing sustainable quinoa as we speak, using their traditional methods."},"environment_urls":{"0":"ecochain.com\/knowledge\/the-environmental-impact-of-quinoa-and-how-we-calculated-it\/","1":"www.onegreenplanet.org\/environment\/how-quinoa-is-shaping-monocultures-and-damaging-biodiversity\/","2":"citizensustainable.com\/quinoa-sustainable\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Quinoa is gluten-free, high in protein and one of the few plant foods that contain sufficient amounts of all nine essential amino acids..\nNASA scientists have been looking at it as a suitable crop to be grown in outer space, mostly based on its high nutrient content, ease of use and simplicity of growing it (3).\nThe United Nations (UN) declared 2013 \u201cThe International Year of Quinoa,\u201d due to its high nutrient value and potential to contribute to food security worldwide (4).\nThis includes plant antioxidants called flavonoids, which have been shown to offer various health benefits.\nTwo flavonoids that have been particularly well studied are quercetin and kaempferol, both found in high amounts in quinoa (5Trusted Source).\nIn fact, the quercetin content of quinoa is even higher than in typical high-quercetin foods like cranberries (6).\nBy including quinoa in your diet, you will significantly increase your total intake of these (and other) important nutrients.\nAnother important benefit of quinoa is its high fiber content.\nNumerous studies show that soluble fiber can help reduce blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol, increase fullness and help with weight loss (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nA gluten-free diet can be healthy, as long as it\u2019s based on foods that are naturally gluten-free.\nProblems arise when people eat gluten-free foods made with refined starches.\nMany researchers have been looking at quinoa as a suitable ingredient in gluten-free diets for people who don\u2019t want to give up staples like bread and pasta.\nStudies have shown that using quinoa instead of typical gluten-free ingredients like refined tapioca, potato, corn and rice flour can dramatically increase the nutrient and antioxidant value of your diet (16, 17Trusted Source).\nUsing it instead of typical gluten-free ingredients can increase the antioxidant and nutrient value of your diet when you\u2019re avoiding gluten.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Protein is made of amino acids, nine of which are called essential, as your body cannot produce them and needs to obtain them through your diet.\nIf a food contains all nine essential amino acids, it\u2019s referred to as a complete protein.\nThe problem is that many plant foods are deficient in certain essential amino acids, such as lysine.\nHowever, quinoa is an exception to this, because it contains sufficient amounts of all the essential amino acids..\nQuinoa is high in protein compared to most plant foods.\nIt also contains all the essential amino acids that you need, making it an excellent protein source for vegetarians and vegans.\nThe problem is that it also contains a substance called phytic acid, which can bind these minerals and reduce their absorption (23Trusted Source).\nHowever, by soaking and\/or sprouting the quinoa prior to cooking, you can reduce the phytic acid content and make these minerals more bioavailable.\nQuinoa is very high in minerals, but its phytic acid can partly prevent them from being absorbed.\nGiven its high beneficial nutrient content, it makes sense that quinoa could improve metabolic health.\nThe human-based study found that using quinoa instead of typical gluten-free breads and pastas significantly reduced blood sugar, insulin and triglyceride levels (26Trusted Source).\nResearch in rats showed that adding quinoa to a diet high in fructose almost completely inhibited the negative effects of fructose (27Trusted Source).\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of quinoa on metabolic health.\nTwo studies, in humans and rats respectively, show that quinoa can improve metabolic health, by reducing blood sugar, insulin and triglyceride levels.\nOne study, researching antioxidant levels in five cereals, three pseudo-cereals and two legumes found that quinoa had the highest antioxidant content of all ten foods (28Trusted Source).\nIt\u2019s high in protein, which can both increase metabolism and reduce appetite significantly (30Trusted Source).\nThe high amount of fiber may increase feelings of fullness, making you eat fewer calories overall (31Trusted Source).\nThe fact that quinoa has a low glycemic index is another important feature, as choosing such foods has been linked to reduced calorie intake (32Trusted Source).\nAlthough there is currently no study that looks at the effects of quinoa on body weight, it seems intuitive that it could be a useful part of a healthy weight loss diet.\nQuinoa is high in fiber, protein and has a low glycemic index.\nWhile not directly a health benefit, the fact that quinoa is very easy to incorporate into your diet is nonetheless important.\nRich in fiber, minerals, antioxidants and all nine essential amino acids, quinoa is one of the healthiest and most nutritious foods on the planet.\nHere are 8 gluten-free grains you can eat instead.","1":"Unlike most plant-based foods, quinoa is a complete protein, which means it contains all of the essential amino acids.\nIncluding whole grains in your diet can help lower your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\nFiber can prevent or treat constipation and may lower your risk of intestinal cancers.\nThe fiber in quinoa can also help with cholesterol and blood sugar levels, lowering your risk of diabetes and heart disease.\nQuinoa is rich in antioxidants, which can prevent damage to your heart and other organs.\nA diet high in antioxidants has been linked with a decreased risk of heart disease.\nCleveland Clinic: \u201cImproving your health with fiber.\u201d Food and Agriculture:
