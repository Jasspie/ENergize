incorporated into other dishes.\nStudies link the consumption of sunflower seeds to a number of health benefits, including lowering your risk of developing diseases like high blood pressure or heart disease.\nSunflower seeds contain vitamin E, flavonoids, and other plant compounds that can reduce inflammation.\nWhile the high levels of protein in sunflower seeds already help boost your energy levels, other nutrients like vitamin B and selenium can help keep you energized.\nSunflower seeds are high in protein and rich in healthy fats, as well as antioxidants that can lower your risk of developing serious conditions.\nWhile sunflower seeds are rich in nutrients, they\u2019re also relatively high in calories.\nIn order to slow the caloric intake while snacking, many eat the seeds in the shell, as it takes time to crack open and spit out each shell.\nEating shelled sunflower seeds requires you to crack them open with your teeth and spit out the shell \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t be eaten.\nThen spit the shell out and eat the seed.\nYou can also eat sunflower seeds in a variety of dishes.","1":"These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about sunflower seeds, including their nutrition, benefits and how to eat them.\nSunflower seeds are technically the fruits of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus) (1Trusted Source).\nA single sunflower head may contain up to 2,000 seeds (2Trusted Source).\nOne type is grown for the seeds you eat, while the other \u2014 which is the majority farmed \u2014 is grown for the oil (1Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, sunflower seeds are a good source of beneficial plant compounds, including phenolic acids and flavonoids \u2014 which also function as antioxidants (6Trusted Source).\nWhen sunflower seeds are sprouted, their plant compounds increase.\nYou can buy sprouted, dried sunflower seeds online or in some stores (6Trusted Source).\nSunflower seeds are excellent sources of several nutrients \u2014 including vitamin E and selenium \u2014 and beneficial plant compounds that can help prevent chronic diseases.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds (1Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nFor example, increased blood levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (11Trusted Source).\nIn a study in more than 6,000 adults, those who reported eating sunflower seeds and other seeds at least five times a week had 32% lower levels of C-reactive protein compared to people who ate no seeds (11Trusted Source).\nThough this type of study cannot prove cause and effect, it is known that vitamin E \u2014 which is abundant in sunflower seeds \u2014 helps lower C-reactive protein levels (12Trusted Source).\nFlavonoids and other plant compounds in sunflower seeds also help reduce inflammation (6Trusted Source).\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease, which can lead to heart attack or stroke (13Trusted Source).\nThe magnesium in sunflower seeds helps reduce blood pressure levels as well (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nThis fatty acid also helps lower cholesterol (14, 15Trusted Source).\nIn a 3-week study, women with type 2 diabetes who ate 1 ounce (30 grams) of sunflower seeds daily as part of a balanced diet experienced a 5% drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of a reading) (7Trusted Source).\nThe effects of sunflower seeds on blood sugar and type 2 diabetes have been tested in a few studies and seem promising, but more research is needed (7Trusted Source, 17).\nStudies suggest that people who eat 1 ounce (30 grams) of sunflower seeds daily as part of a healthy diet may reduce fasting blood sugar by about 10% within six months, compared to a healthy diet alone (7Trusted Source, 18).\nThe blood-sugar-lowering effect of sunflower seeds may partially be due to the plant compound chlorogenic acid (19Trusted Source, 20).\nStudies also suggest that adding sunflower seeds to foods like bread may help decrease carbs\u2019 effect on your blood sugar.\nSunflower seeds contain nutrients and plant compounds that help reduce your risk of inflammation, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nEating the seeds in the shell is a simple way to slow your eating pace and calorie intake while snacking, as it takes time to crack open and spit out each shell.\nHowever, if you\u2019re watching your salt intake, keep in mind that the shells \u2014 which people commonly suck on before cracking them open \u2014 are often coated with more than 2,500 mg of sodium \u2014 108% of the RDI \u2014 per 1\/4 cup (30 grams) (23Trusted Source).\nSunflowers tend to take up cadmium from the soil and deposit it in their seeds, so they contain somewhat higher amounts than most other foods (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).\nOccasionally, seeds are contaminated with harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella, which can thrive in the warm, moist conditions of sprouting (27Trusted Source).\nOne study found that drying partially sprouted sunflower seeds at temperatures of 122\u2109 (50\u2103) and above significantly reduced Salmonella presence (27Trusted Source).\nEating a large number of sunflower seeds at once has occasionally resulted in fecal impaction \u2014 or stool blockages \u2014 in both children and adults (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nEating sunflower seeds in the shell may increase your odds of fecal impaction, as you may unintentionally eat shell fragments, which your body cannot digest (28Trusted Source).\nUnshelled sunflower seeds are a popular snack, while shelled varieties can be eaten by the handful or added to any number of foods, such as trail mix, salads and baked goods.\nThey pack various nutrients and plant compounds that may help fight inflammation,

good health, including selenium and\u00a0vitamin E, which may have anti-cancer properties both in the formation of tumors and possibly in slowing down the progression of the disease.\nLet\u2019s get started\u2026 Sunflower seeds are loaded with nutrition, including a number of minerals and vitamins and lots of phytosterols, protein, fat, and fiber.\nFrom a mineral perspective, sunflower seeds also contain high amounts of selenium, manganese, copper, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as some calcium, iron, potassium, and zinc.\nTwo nutrients that improve cardiovascular health are vitamin E and folate, both of which are found in sunflower seeds.\nAlso, anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants in sunflower seeds help reduce oxidative stress and damaging free radicals in the body.\nSunflower seeds contain phytosterols that have been linked to healthy cholesterol levels.\nThe phytosterols in sunflower seeds help balance high cholesterol levels, and this can help prevent cardiovascular disease overall.\nThe magnesium content in sunflower seeds can help\u00a0lower blood pressure\u00a0and help reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, but only if you eat them unsalted.\nBecause of their high levels of antioxidants, other nutrients, and specific chemo-preventive compounds, sunflower seeds can help\u00a0prevent cancer and tumor growth.\nThe antioxidants in sunflower seeds are important for slowing the growth of mutated cancer cells and promoting DNA repair.\nResearch has found that the antioxidant gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E) in sunflower seeds can help in cancer prevention.\nThe selenium in sunflower seeds is another important antioxidant for breast cancer prevention.\nResearch even shows that selenium can help with DNA repair and detoxify the body of damaged cells.\nSince sunflower seeds are very high in selenium, just a handful daily can benefit your body.\nOne of the more peculiar health benefits of sunflower seeds is how they can help calm nerves and anxiety, and help reduce the pain associated with migraines.\nSunflower seeds are high in fiber, and as a result, can help with\u00a0constipation.\nThe magnesium content in sunflower seeds can help improve overall mental health.\nThe vitamin E found in sunflower seeds can protect the skin from oxidative damage caused by environmental exposure and can support the growth of healthy, new skin cells.\nThe seeds can potentially help reduce osteoporosis symptoms, including a stooped posture, backaches, and bones that break easily.\nThe high amount of magnesium in sunflower seeds plays an important role in bone health.\nMagnesium helps keep the skeletal structure healthy, and this is important for preventing bone mineral density loss in osteoporosis.\nA diet high in nuts and seeds has been found to balance blood sugar levels and reduce hyperglycemia.\nThe many nutrients in sunflower seeds help mitigate the complications of blood sugar imbalance that often result from an unhealthy diet.\nSunflower seeds contain a lot of protein, and protein contains amino acids like tryptophan, which can help boost your mood.\nEating foods high in tryptophan like sunflower seeds can improve mood and benefit social behavior.\nSunflower seeds are incredibly good for us and provide many nutritional benefits, but like everything else in life, they do need to be eaten in moderation.\nThe seeds are high in fat, and even though they are sources of good fat, they can still lead to weight gain if you have too many of them, regardless of how beneficial they may be for you.\nSunflower seeds
