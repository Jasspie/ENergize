production is relatively sustainable, there is no known significant damage to air, water, land, soil, forests, etc.\nItaly is the world\u2019s largest artichoke producer followed by Egypt, Spain, Argentina, Peru, Algeria, China, Morocco, United States (California provides nearly 100% of the U.S. crop), France, Turkey, Tunisia.\nThose who eat seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables\u00a0per day have a 33% reduced risk of premature death compared to people who eat less than one portion.\nA plant-based diet could lower your risk of diabetes\u2026\u00a0Consider this: In the United States, 29.1 million people have diabetes (about 10% of the population).\nThe World Health Organization's first step to healthy eating is: \"Eat a nutritious diet based on a variety of foods originating mainly from plants, rather than animals\".\nAccording to Marjorie Nolan, an American Dietetic Association spokeswoman, clinical studies have shown that eating high-alkaline foods and staying properly hydrated reduce the rate of cancer and other diseases.\nIt\u2019s important for our health to drink lots of water and eat foods that hydrate.\nIn industrialized countries, moving toward a vegetarian diet can reduce the water-related footprint of people by 36%\u201d.\nWhen calculating product emissions, some factors that may be included are\u2026 farm equipment, animal feed production, hothouses (greenhouses), food processing, packaging, transport, refrigeration, freezing, package waste, and more.\nAccording to Oxford Martin School researchers, if the world went vegan, eliminating animal-derived products, it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds and avoid climate damages of $1.5 trillion.\nBuying food without packaging reduces waste as well as the carbon footprint.\nGrowing plant-based foods at home is the most environmentally sustainable method with zero carbon footprint.\nA\u00a02018 Oxford University study\u00a0\u2013 which is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet \u2013 found that \u2018avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your impact on Earth\u2019 as animal farming provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of our farmland.\nA 2010 United Nations report said that a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world the worst impacts of climate change.\nArtichokes are a vegetable and not an animal product or byproduct, therefore making it a vegan food.\nAccording to Sentient Media, \u201cmore than 200 million land animals are killed for food around the world every day.\nIncluding wild-caught and farmed fishes, we get a total closer to 3 billion animals killed daily.\u201d Wild-caught fish:\u00a0An estimated 2.7 billion wild-caught fish are killed for food every day worldwide.\nChicken: An estimated 178 million chicken are killed for food every day worldwide.\nFarmed fish:\u00a0An estimated 300 million farmed fish are killed for food

Health Benefits, Nutrients, Preparation, and More"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Its alleged health benefits include lower blood sugar levels and improved digestion, heart health, and liver health.\nA medium artichoke (128 grams raw, 120 grams cooked) contains (1Trusted Source): Artichokes are low in fat while rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nArtichoke leaf extract may have a positive effect on cholesterol levels (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nA large review in over 700 people found that supplementing with artichoke leaf extract daily for 5\u201313 weeks led to a reduction in total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol (6Trusted Source).\nOne study in 143 adults with high cholesterol showed that artichoke leaf extract taken daily for six weeks resulted in an 18.5% and 22.9% decrease in total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, respectively (7Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, an animal study reported a 30% reduction in \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol and a 22% reduction in triglycerides after regular consumption of artichoke extract (8Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, regularly consuming artichoke extract may boost \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol in adults with high cholesterol (5Trusted Source).\nSecond, artichoke leaf extract encourages your body to process cholesterol more efficiently, leading to lower overall levels (8Trusted Source).\nOne study in 98 men with high blood pressure found that consuming artichoke extract daily for 12 weeks reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by an average of 2.76 and 2.85 mmHg, respectively (10Trusted Source).\nHowever, test-tube and animal studies indicate that artichoke extract promotes the enzyme eNOS, which plays a role in widening blood vessels (9Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nThat said, it is unclear whether consuming whole artichokes provides the same benefits, as the artichoke extract used in these studies is highly concentrated.\nIn one study, artichoke extract given to rats resulted in less liver damage, higher antioxidant levels, and better liver function after an induced drug overdose, compared to rats not given artichoke extract (16Trusted Source).\nFor example, one trial in 90 people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease revealed that consuming 600 mg of artichoke extract daily for two months led to improved liver function (17Trusted Source).\nIn another study in obese adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, taking artichoke extract daily for two months resulted in reduced liver inflammation and less fat deposition than not consuming artichoke extract (18).\nScientists think that certain antioxidants found in artichokes \u2014 cynarin and silymarin \u2014 are partly responsible for these benefits (14Trusted Source).\nArtichokes are a great source of fiber, which can help keep your digestive system healthy by promoting friendly gut bacteria, reducing your risk of certain bowel cancers, and alleviating constipation and diarrhea (23, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nIn one study, 12 adults experienced an improvement in gut bacteria when they consumed an artichoke extract containing inulin each day for three weeks (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nA study in 247 people with indigestion determined that consuming artichoke leaf extract daily for six weeks reduced symptoms, such as flatulence and uncomfortable feelings of fullness, compared to not taking artichoke leaf extract (29Trusted Source).\nCynarin, a naturally occurring compound in artichokes, may cause these positive effects by stimulating bile production, accelerating gut movement, and improving the digestion of certain fats (9Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nIn one study in people with IBS, consuming artichoke leaf extract daily for six weeks helped ease symptoms.\nAnother study in 208 people with IBS discovered that 1-2 capsules of artichoke leaf extract, consumed daily for two months, reduced symptoms by 26% and improved quality of life by 20% (20Trusted Source).\nWhile artichoke extract seems promising for treating IBS symptoms, larger human studies are needed.\nArtichokes and artichoke leaf extract may help lower blood sugar levels (9Trusted Source).\nOne study in 39 overweight adults found that consuming kidney bean and artichoke extract daily for two months lowered fasting blood sugar levels compared to not supplementing (30Trusted Source).\nAnother small study indicated that consuming boiled artichoke at a meal reduced blood sugar and insulin levels 30 minutes after eating.\nCertain antioxidants \u2014 including rutin, quercetin, silymarin, and gallic acid \u2014 in artichokes are thought responsible for these anticancer effects (9Trusted Source).\nFor example, silymarin was found to help prevent and treat skin cancer in animal and test-tube studies (36Trusted Source).\nHowever, typical doses used in human research range from 300\u2013640 mg of artichoke leaf extract three times daily (7Trusted Source).\nRegular consumption of artichoke extract may aid cholesterol levels, blood pressure, liver health, IBS, indigestion, and blood sugar levels.","1":"Artichoke extract supplements \u2014 which provide a concentrated dose of the veggie\u2019s protective compounds, including chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin and cymaroside \u2014 have also been shown to have cholesterol-lowering and disease-fighting effects.\nDue to its high fiber quantity and phytonutrients, artichoke nutrition has a strong tie to preventing serious conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, as well as having positive effects on liver and digestive health.\nThe name artichoke comes from the \u00a0word\u00a0articiocco, which is most likely influenced by the word ciocco, meaning \u201cstump.\u201d The globe artichoke \u2014 the kind most often eaten today \u2014 is from the thistle species, a group of flowering plants characterized by leaves with sharp prickles on their margins.\nSome noteworthy artichoke health benefits include having a high antioxidant content that may help prevent cancer, manage weight, and control blood sugar and diabetes \u2014 plus their ability to provide a good source of fiber and other nutrients.\nIn fact, artichoke extract supplements, which have become more popular over recent years due to their various heart health-promoting benefits, are largely derived from antioxidants and phytonutrients found in the leaves of this vegetable.\nLeaf extracts of the artichoke plant are used for their liver (hepato) protectant properties and also have anti-carcinogenic, antioxidative, antiviral and antibacterial effects.\nThe nutritional value of artichokes is also impressive considering one only provides about 60 calories but over 10 percent of your daily needs of six different essential nutrients.\nArtichokes are a\u00a0high-antioxidant food\u00a0and have a\u00a0high ORAC score (oxygen radical absorption capacity), which tests the power of a plant to absorb and eliminate free radicals.\nCompounds present in artichokes \u2014 specifically rutin,\u00a0quercetin\u00a0and gallic acid \u2014 have been shown in studies to reduce the growth of cancerous cells and therefore prevent cancerous tumors from proliferating.\nResearch published in both the\u00a0Journal of Cellular Physiology\u00a0and\u00a0Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity\u00a0found that polyphenolic extracts from the edible parts of artichokes \u201cinduce apoptosis and decrease the invasive potential of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231.\u201d Another study conducted by the National Research Centre\u2019s Medicinal Chemistry Department in Dokki Giza, Egypt, looked at the protective effects of fish oil and artichokes on hepatocellular carcinoma in rats.\nThe researchers concluded after dividing the rats into eight groups, \u201cthe results pointed that 10% fish oil and 1 g% leaves of artichoke succeeded to protect from hepatocellular carcinoma to a certain degree.\nIn addition, they may be considered as protective foods against angiogenesis.\u201d Consuming artichokes and artichoke extract has been correlated with reductions in unhealthy cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome.\nArtichoke nutrition may also help calm inflammation in the body and improve blood flow.\nLuckily the powerful substance cynarin found in artichoke nutrition is one of the best\u00a0natural remedies for bringing cholesterol\u00a0back to a healthy level.\nResearch shows that the lipidic- and glycemic-reducing action of artichokes also help them prevent\u00a0coronary heart disease\u00a0and metabolic disorders.\nThe cholesterol-lowering effects of artichoke hearts can be attributed mainly to its soluble fibers, particularly the kind called inulin.\nOne double-blind, randomized controlled trial also found that supplementing with artichoke leaf extract reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.\nArtichoke extract and juice have also been shown to fight high blood pressure\/hypertension.\nBecause of their ability to boost the production of digestive bile and to detox the body, artichokes are included on\u00a0the GAPS diet plan protocol,\u00a0which is a diet that was specifically created to nourish the digestive tract and restore proper gut health.\nEating GAPS diet-approved foods like artichokes is correlated with improving gut flora, reducing symptoms related to digestive disease and boosting immunity \u2014 since much of the immune system is actually held within the gut.\nArtichokes may even be able to help liver cells regenerate.\nA 2018 study found that\u00a0artichoke extract supplementation increases antioxidant status in the liver, including levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase.\nAnother substance in artichoke nutrition called cynarin has also been shown to positively stimulate the production of bile, which is produced by the liver and ultimately responsible for enabling digestion and helping with the absorption of nutrients.\nIt\u2019s believed that the artichoke benefits IBS and other digestive disorders because of its high fiber content, ability to reduce inflammation, and artichoke\u2019s nourishing effect on the gut lining and liver.\nOne study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine also found that artichoke leaf extract can be very helpful in relieving symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the leading digestive disorders in the world.\nArtichokes are very\u00a0high in fiber, which is crucial for numerous functions in the body.\nStudies have shown that consuming plenty of soluble fiber, like the kind found in artichoke nutrition, is a great way to keep off dangerous\u00a0visceral fat\u00a0\u2014 the kind that accumulates around your organs and can lead to various diseases.\nA diet high in fiber is correlated with maintaining a healthy weight and also reducing the risk for serious conditions, including colon cancer, heart disease and more.\nArtichokes nutrition may help with\u00a0weight loss\u00a0because it has the ability to swell and expand in your stomach and intestines, soaking up fluid and giving you the feeling of being full.\nThe high amount of fiber found in artichoke nutrition means artichokes can help normalize\u00a0blood sugar levels , avoiding spikes and dips in insulin that can lead to serious problems for diabetics.\nThe fiber in artichoke nutrition allows glucose to be absorbed in the blood more slowly, and because fiber is a substance that can be digested and does not require insulin, fiber does not count toward the amount of carbohydrates or glucose you consume.\nOne animal study found that supplementation with artichoke extract helped prevent adiposity and related metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammation.\nWhile many people think of animal products, like beef and eggs, as the only and best sources of iron, artichokes are also a good source,\u00a0especially for\u00a0plant-based eaters\u00a0who need to make sure they consume enough of the vital mineral.\nArtichoke benefits for skin include supporting your immune system and supplying antioxidants that fight free radicals.\nThe artichoke should be a healthy green color, and it should look fresh, not dehydrated.\nThis means that the artichoke is fresh, and it will be tender when eating.\nIn order to keep your artichoke fresh, it needs to be stored properly.\nIt\u2019s best to cook the artichoke within a week of buying it if possible.\nBefore eating an artichoke, remove the purple part using a knife, since under the\u00a0purple\u00a0leaves is the fuzzy, grayish-brown choke that is edible.\nThese are a healthy addition to your diet but have a higher sodium content than fresh artichokes, as do canned hearts.\nThe taste seems to depend on how you cook artichokes and the specific type.\nThe most complementary ingredients for an artichoke include olive oil, lemon,\u00a0parsley, rosemary, high-quality cheeses, red onion, arugula, salt and pepper.\nStart by pulling off a petal from the cooked inside part of the artichoke.\nOnce you consume all of the petals, remove the fuzzy layer that\u2019s covering the heart of the artichoke.\nBy increasing the bile flow in the body, gallstones may become worse, so if you suffer from gallstones, use precaution when consuming artichokes.","2":"When steamed, artichokes have a tender texture and a sweet, earthy taste that make them an excellent addition to dips and sauces, as well as a perfect stand-alone snack.\nOne study showed that artichoke leaf juice helped regulate blood pressure for people with mild high blood pressure.\nThough studies are still in their early stages, researchers believe that the high levels of potassium in artichokes may be a contributing factor to this effect.\nEarly studies suggest that artichoke leaf extract may help lower cholesterol levels.\nBecause research on these effects have been limited and the sample sizes were relatively small, however, artichokes are not yet being recommended as a treatment for high cholesterol.\nA few small studies have shown that artichoke can improve liver function for people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nThough there\u2019s no data yet about its effect on alcoholic fatty liver disease, there\u2019s evidence that artichoke leaf extract can contribute to overall liver health.\nOnce your artichoke has been steamed, you have a few different options for eating it.\nSome people choose to peel away the petals of the artichoke and only eat the center, or \"heart.\u201d However, some of the best nutrients are concentrated in the leaves.\n\"Artichoke leaf juice contains antihypertensive effect in patients with mild hypertension.\" Phytotherapy
