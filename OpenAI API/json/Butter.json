A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.\nNow, when I cook or bake, I substitute butter made from cow\u2019s milk with coconut oil, olive oil, or commercial vegan butter (like Earth Balance).\nBut as a friend recently pointed out, the energy needed to process these products could actually be more than the energy required to raise a cow and make butter from its milk.\nIt\u2019s true that turning something like an olive, soybean, rapeseed (the raw material behind canola oil), or sunflower seed into a gleaming oil or spread takes energy \u2014 not to mention the land and water required to grow said olive\/bean\/seed, plus any fertilizers or pesticides that get involved along the way.\nBut it\u2019s also true that any dairy product has to answer for the huge carbon footprint that comes from raising cows (head over to this recent column for more on that \u2014 in short, it\u2019s all about methane).\nWhat we need here is a scientific comparison of butter versus plant-based oils, and lucky us, we have one.\nThis 2010 study looked at butter and margarine, which (depending on the brand) is based on some combination of vegetable oils, so it\u2019s a nice window into your question.\nThe researchers found that butter has more than double the environmental impact of margarine when it comes to climate change; it also caused more water and air pollution problems.\nThe only place butter came up looking rosier than margarine was in regards to ozone, because some oil-extraction techniques involve the use of the ozone-creating chemical hexane.\nThat report also looked at butter-veggie oil blends, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, the higher the proportion of oil, the lower the product\u2019s footprint.\nFor one, skip palm oil, that rainforest-destroying, animal-endangering option found in far too many products, including the aforementioned margarine, peanut butter, and chocolate.\nSunflower oil and rapeseed (canola) oil had the lowest carbon footprints and water consumption, beating out soy, palm, and peanut oil by wide margins.\nI am not strictly vegan myself, but I would never turn down an olive-oil cheesecake.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate, justice, and solutions.\nYour support helps Grist reveal the under-reported connection between social justice and climate change.","1":"In this study, an environmental life cycle assessment was performed in order to estimate the environmental impacts associated with the manufacture of milk powder and butter in the Republic of Ireland.\nEnergy consumption (raw milk transportation and on-site electrical and thermal energy usage) contributes, on average, 89% and 78% of the total global warming potential, for milk powder and butter respectively, for the life cycle stages assessed.\nSimilarly, energy consumption contributes, on average, 86% and 96% of the total terrestrial acidification potential for milk powder and butter respectively, for these life cycle stages.\nButter;
