How to Select - Dr. Axe"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"What\u2019s more, peaches are nutritious and may offer an array of health benefits, including improved digestion, smoother skin, and allergy relief.\nIn one study, juice from fresh peaches demonstrated antioxidant actions in healthy men within 30 minutes of consumption (7Trusted Source).\nFresh and canned peaches seem to have similar amounts of vitamins and minerals \u2014 as long as canned varieties are unpeeled (8Trusted Source, 9).\nHowever, fresh peaches have higher levels of antioxidants and appear to be more effective at protecting against oxidative damage than canned ones (9, 10Trusted Source).\nPeach flowers are another part of the fruit that may benefit digestion.\nAnimal research shows that compounds found in the flowers may effectively increase the strength and frequency of gut contractions, which helps maintain the proper rhythm to push food along smoothly (16Trusted Source).\nWhile studies often use peach flower extract, an herbal tea made from the flowers is commonly consumed in Korea (17Trusted Source).\nRegularly eating fruit \u2014 including peaches \u2014 may promote heart health.\nPeaches may lower risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol levels (18Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, test-tube studies show that peaches may bind to bile acids \u2014 compounds produced by your liver from cholesterol.\nAdditional test-tube and animal studies found that peaches may reduce total and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol levels, as well as blood pressure and triglyceride levels (20, 21, 22Trusted Source).\nResearch in obese rats further reported that peach juice may lower levels of the hormone angiotensin II that raises blood pressure (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nPeaches may have protective effects that help keep your skin healthy.\nTest-tube studies indicate that compounds found in peaches may improve your skin\u2019s ability to retain moisture \u2014 thus improving skin texture (24Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, both test-tube and animal studies show that extracts made from peach flowers or flesh applied directly to the skin may help prevent UV damage (25, 26Trusted Source, 27).\nPeach flower extracts were also found to delay the development of skin tumors in mice (28Trusted Source).\nLike most fruits, peaches provide beneficial plant compounds that may offer some protection against various cancers.\nTest-tube and animal research has also shown that compounds in peach seeds may limit the growth of non-cancerous skin tumors and prevent them from turning into cancerous ones (33Trusted Source).\nNot to mention, peaches are full of polyphenols \u2014 a category of antioxidants shown to reduce the growth and limit the spreading of cancer cells in test-tube studies (34Trusted Source).\nPeach polyphenols may have the ability to kill cancerous cells as well, without causing any damage to healthy ones (35Trusted Source).\nResearchers reported that a person would need to eat about two to three peaches a day to consume an amount of polyphenols equivalent to that used in the study (34Trusted Source).\nIn another study, postmenopausal women who consumed at least 2 peaches or nectarines each day had a 41% lower risk of breast cancer over 24 years (36Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that peaches may help reduce allergy symptoms by preventing the release of histamines in the blood (37Trusted Source).\nMoreover, test-tube studies report that peach extracts may be effective as well and limit the inflammation commonly seen in allergic reactions (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nKeep in mind that canned peaches tend to contain fewer antioxidants than fresh or frozen peaches, and for a healthier choice, try opting for a variety packed in water instead of syrup (9, 10Trusted Source).\nThey\u2019re easily incorporated into a variety of dishes and may offer impressive health benefits, including healthier skin, fewer allergy symptoms, and improved digestion and heart health.\nEating fruit can boost your health and help prevent disease.","1":"The stone fruit family also includes apricots, which are fuzzy like peaches but smaller, firmer, and less sweet, and nectarines, which have smooth, fuzz-free skin.\nA diet high in fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of developing diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and some types of cancer.\nFor instance, the antioxidants in peaches may protect against the damage from free radicals (harmful molecules that affect cells) that can lead to heart disease and cancer.\nOne of these antioxidants is vitamin C, which the body also needs to fight off infections.\nVitamin A is another antioxidant found in peaches that also helps your immune system fight infection.\nPeaches are a good source of potassium, which your body uses to regulate your heart rate and blood pressure.\nOn top of antioxidant protection and the benefits of potassium, peaches also contain fiber.\nFiber is mostly known for helping your digestive system work and your body maintain a healthy weight.\nIt also helps protect your skin from damage by free radicals.\nPeaches are a good source of vitamins C and K, which your body uses to heal wounds.\nVitamin E boosts your immune system and helps your eyes and skin stay healthy.\nAmerican

cancer and protect your heart from disease.\nPeaches are high-antioxidant foods that have anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties, which is why peach nutrition offers a slew of impressive health benefits.\nThe peach is known officially as Prunus persica, earning its unique name from the journey it took from its location of origin, China, through Persia via the Silk Road to Europe.\nBoth common peach types can be cultivated with a white or yellow peel, each of which has flecks or lines of red in the skin.\nOne of the greatest qualities in peach nutrition is the high quantity of antioxidants found in these delicious fruits.\nPeaches display strong\u00a0antioxidant properties that have long-term implications for fighting disease and ridding the body of free radicals.\nIn fact, many fruit juices (including freshly squeezed peach juice) begin the process of relieving oxidative stress in just 30 minutes after you consume them.\n(2) As with many types of food, the specific variety of peach determines the exact antioxidant load.\n(4) Caffeic acid is an antioxidant specifically found in high levels in peach nutrition.\n(6) Considering the mountain of evidence linking aflatoxin with cancer, the presence of caffeic acid in peaches is an especially important reason to eat them regularly.\nLike so many whole, fresh foods, peaches have been strongly linked to the prevention and regression of various cancers, placing them among some of the best cancer-fighting foods around.\nAccording to a 2014 study by researchers at Texas A&M, polyphenols in peaches (and plums) successfully inhibited the growth and metastasis (spreading to other organs) of at least one strain of breast cancer cells.\nThey recommend breast cancer patients eat two to three peaches a day to experience the same cancer-protective effects.\n(8) Caffeic acid, the antioxidant found so richly in peaches, can inhibit a type of fibrocarcinoma, a tumor that grows in fibrous connective tissue.\n(9) Certain colon cancers are also stunted in their growth by the consumption of peaches and similar fruits.\nIn traditional Asian medicine, the seed of the peach has been used for millennia in the treatment of many diseases.\nIn 2003, scientists found that the compounds in peach seeds reduce the growth of papilloma (tumors) on the skin and slow their carcinogenesis, the process by which benign tumors develop into cancer.\nPeach flower extract, through antioxidation, protects your skin from UV damage and the development of skin cancer.\n(11) While I don\u2019t recommend chemotherapy treatments for cancer until all natural options have been exhausted, peach nutrition also offers help alongside the use of the common chemotherapy drug cisplatin.\nWhen cisplatin is administered alongside peach skin, however, the degree to which the liver was damaged was drastically reduced in one 2008 study in Korea.\nHowever, peaches (along with plums and apricots) offer hope for the occurrence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.\nThese \u201cstone fruits,\u201d termed as such because of their large inner seed shells, have proved to have a unique combination of bioactive compounds that, together, create drastic improvement in individuals at risk for heart disease.\nWhile all of the antioxidants, anti-inflammatory nutrients, and other vitamins and minerals in peaches may be found in other foods, researchers believe the fusion of the specific levels of these nutrients is what makes them so special.\n(13) One study examined\u00a0the effect of replacing sugary drinks with natural fruit juices high in polyphenols and found it had a significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n(14) One study of over 1,300 people in China tested the effect of higher bioflavonoid consumption from fruits, including peaches, and found that, especially in women, the subjects\u2019 lipid profiles all showed improvement.\nBecause inflammation is at the root of most diseases, it\u2019s also helpful to know that peaches and other fruits like it help decrease inflammation levels in the body.\n(16) Fresh pulp and peel from peaches have serious fighting power against inflammation that causes cell death in the body, making peaches\u00a0excellent anti-inflammatory foods.\nNot only does the extract of peach flowers protect against certain cancers, but it\u2019s also a reasonable treatment for certain gut disorders known as motility disorders.\nPeach nutrition fights and eliminates the growth of candida fungus with its combination of polyphenols, bioflavonoids and condensed tannins.\n(18) Because they contain the powerful antioxidants like\u00a0lutein, peaches also help to protect your eyes and keep them healthy.\n(19) In addition to its many vitamins and minerals, low calorie content and, of course, delicious flavor, the peach also comes packed with great antioxidants, including all five classifications of carotenoids.\nAs a great source of vitamin A and vitamin C, plus beneficial fiber, it\u2019s no wonder peaches are such a wonder fruit when it comes to maintaining optimal health and fighting disease.\nPeach seeds have been used for many centuries as a part of Chinese medicine to treat various conditions, such as blood stasis, inflammation and allergies.\nCanned peaches lose about 21 percent of their antioxidant load.\nSome research indicates that peach seeds in particular have fairly impressive health benefits, but again, further research is needed.\nIt\u2019s one of the most popular ways to eat peaches, and for good reason.\nAs a fruit, peaches probably should be consumed earlier in the day rather than later because of the way the sugar content in them is processed.\n(24) I also mentioned before that there are trace amounts of cyanide in peach seeds."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/peach-fruit-benefits","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-peaches","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/peach-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
