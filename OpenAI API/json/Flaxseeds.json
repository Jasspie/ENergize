Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Just one tablespoon provides a good amount of protein, fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to being a rich source of some vitamins and minerals.\nInterestingly, flax seeds\u2019 health benefits are mainly attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids, lignans and fiber they contain.\nTheir health benefits are mainly due to their content of omega-3 fats, lignans and fiber.\nAnimal studies have shown that the ALA in flax seeds prevented cholesterol from being deposited in the blood vessels of the heart, reduced inflammation in the arteries and reduced tumor growth (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nA Costa Rican study involving 3,638 people found that those who ate more ALA had a lower risk of heart attack than those who consumed less ALA (6Trusted Source).\nAlso, a large review of 27 studies involving more than 250,000 people found that ALA was linked to a 14% lower risk of heart disease (7Trusted Source).\nPlant-based ALA fatty acids are proven to have heart health benefits and are linked to a lower risk of stroke.\nLignans are plant compounds that have antioxidant and estrogen properties, both of which can help lower the risk of cancer and improve health (12Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, flax seeds contain up to 800 times more lignans than other plant foods (5Trusted Source).\nObservational studies show that those who eat flax seeds have a lower risk of breast cancer, particularly postmenopausal women (13Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, according to a Canadian study involving more than 6,000 women, those who eat flax seeds are 18% less likely to develop breast cancer (14Trusted Source).\nIn a small study including 15 men, those given 30 grams of flax seeds a day while following a low-fat diet showed reduced levels of a prostate cancer marker, suggesting a lower risk of prostate cancer (15Trusted Source).\nJust one tablespoon of flax seeds contains 3 grams of fiber, which is 8\u201312% of the daily recommended intake for men and women, respectively (17Trusted Source).\nThis has been shown to help regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol (18Trusted Source).\nWith so much fiber packed in each tiny seed, adding flax seeds to your diet promotes regular bowel movements and can improve your digestive health.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Another health benefit of flax seeds is their ability to lower cholesterol levels.\nIn one study in people with high cholesterol, consuming 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of flaxseed powder daily for three months lowered total cholesterol by 17% and \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol by almost 20% (19Trusted Source).\nAnother study of people with diabetes found that taking 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of flaxseed powder daily for one month resulted in a 12% increase in \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol (20Trusted Source).\nIn postmenopausal women, consuming 30 grams of flax seeds daily lowered total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by approximately 7% and 10%, respectively (21Trusted Source).\nThis process lowers your blood levels of cholesterol (18Trusted Source).\nThe high fiber content of flax seeds can help lower cholesterol and may play an important role in improving heart health.\nStudies on flax seeds have also focused on its natural ability to lower blood pressure (22Trusted Source).\nA Canadian study found eating 30 grams of flax seeds daily for six months lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg and 7 mmHg, respectively (23Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, according to a large review that looked at data from 11 studies, taking flax seeds daily for more than three months lowered blood pressure by 2 mmHg (24Trusted Source).\nWhile that might seem insignificant, a 2-mmHg reduction in blood pressure can lower the risk of dying from stroke by 10% and from heart disease by 7% (25Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds are a great source of plant-based protein, and there\u2019s growing interest in flaxseed protein and its health benefits.\nNumerous lab and animal studies have shown that flaxseed protein helped improve immune function, lowered cholesterol, prevented tumors and had anti-fungal properties (28Trusted Source, 29, 30Trusted Source).\nA few studies have found that people with type 2 diabetes who added 10\u201320 grams of flaxseed powder to their daily diet for at least one month saw reductions of 8\u201320% in blood sugar levels (20Trusted Source, 32, 33).\nThis blood sugar-lowering effect is notably due to flax seeds\u2019 insoluble fiber content.\nHowever, one study found no change in blood sugar levels or any improvement in diabetes management (35Trusted Source).\nFlaxseed oil lacks fiber, which is credited with flax seeds\u2019 ability to lower blood sugar.\nFlax seeds may lower blood sugar due to their insoluble fiber content.\nOne study found that adding 2.5 grams of ground flax fiber extract to a beverage reduced feelings of hunger and overall appetite (36Trusted Source).\nThe resurgence of the use of flaxseed oil is due to its nutritional properties and health benefits.\nThe health benefits noted in the studies above were observed with just 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of ground flax seeds per day.\nThough tiny, they are rich in the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, lignans and fiber, all of which have been shown to have many potential health benefits.\nThey can be used to improve digestive health, lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of cancer and may benefit people with diabetes.","1":"In fact, its Latin name, Linum usitatissimum, means \u201cvery useful.\u201d Today, flaxseed is an important addition to many diets, offering health benefits for everything from heart health to blood sugar levels.\nThe vitamins, minerals, and fiber in flaxseed can provide important health benefits.\nFlaxseed has been shown to improve heart health in a number of different ways.\nFlaxseed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help lower your risk of heart attacks.\nFlaxseed has both insoluble and soluble forms of dietary fiber, which can improve your digestive system in several ways.\nSupplementing your diet with flaxseed may also help you manage your blood sugar more effectively.\nThe same small study on the cholesterol-lowering effects of flaxseed also found that people with diabetes who add flaxseed to their diet see a decrease of nearly 20% in their fasting glucose.\nWhile flaxseed is not a substitute for other forms of blood sugar management, it may help people living with diabetes better control their glucose levels.\nMost studies show that eating just 30 grams of flaxseed per day is enough to see health benefits.\nEating one or two servings of flaxseed per day may help you improve your health without consuming too many calories.","2":"This is due to their high content of heart-healthy omega-3 fats, fiber, and other unique plant compounds (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds have been linked to health benefits, such as improved digestion and a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.\nConsuming flax seeds can help promote regularity, prevent constipation, and reduce your risk of diabetes (2Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nStill, flax seeds are high in the amino acids arginine and glutamine \u2014 both of which are important for heart and immune system health (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nEating the seeds whole provides the least amount of ALA, as the oil is locked up inside the fibrous structure of the seed (16Trusted Source).\nDue to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids, flax seeds have a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 than many other oil seeds.\nA lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to a lower risk of various chronic diseases (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nThey\u2019re also rich in fat and one of the best plant-based sources of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nThey have been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome, as they reduce levels of fat and glucose in your blood.\nFlax lignans also help reduce blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation in your arteries (31Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds are high in several plant compounds, including p-Coumaric acid, ferulic acid, cyanogenic glycosides, phytosterols, and lignans.\nThe analysis also showed that weight loss tended to be greater in studies lasting for more than 12 weeks and among those who consumed more than 30 grams of flax seeds per day (35Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds contain soluble fiber, which may promote weight loss by reducing hunger and decreasing cravings.\nFlax seeds have been associated with major benefits for heart health, mainly attributed to their content of omega-3 fatty acids, lignans, and fiber.\nHuman studies note that daily consumption of flax seeds \u2014 or flaxseed oil \u2014 may lower cholesterol by 6\u201311%.\nThis is supported by animal studies showing that flax seeds may improve cholesterol levels and the composition of blood fats (40Trusted Source, 41, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nOne 12-month study found that flax seeds caused an additional 8.5% reduction in LDL (bad) cholesterol, compared to a control group (45Trusted Source).\nThis cholesterol-lowering effect is thought to be caused by the high fiber and lignan content in flax seeds.\nThis reduces cholesterol levels in your body (46Trusted Source).\nThey may have benefits for various aspects of heart health, including blood platelet function, inflammation, and blood pressure.\nThey have been shown to decrease heart disease risk in animal studies by reducing inflammation in the arteries (47Trusted Source).\nSeveral studies link ALA with a lower risk of stroke, heart attacks, and chronic kidney disease.\nThose receiving the supplement had significantly lower rates of death and heart attacks than people in the control group (52Trusted Source).\nPlant-based ALA fatty acids seem to benefit heart health similarly to fish oils, which are rich in EPA and DHA (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55).\nEating flax seeds is an effective way to lower blood pressure (31Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).\nIn a 6-month study in people with elevated blood pressure, those consuming 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of flax seeds daily experienced a 10 and 7 mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.\nPeople with a systolic level \u2014 the top number in a blood pressure reading \u2014 greater than 140 mm Hg at the start of the study observed an even greater reduction of 15 mm Hg (56Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds may help fight heart disease by lowering blood pressure, regulating blood cholesterol, and increasing your levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nThe insoluble fiber content in flax seeds adds bulk to your digestive waste, acting as a laxative and relieving constipation (32Trusted Source, 67).\nStudies in people with type 2 diabetes show that supplementing with 10\u201320 grams of flaxseed powder per day for 1\u20132 months may reduce fasting blood sugar by up to 19.7% (69Trusted Source, 70).\nHowever, not all studies find flax seeds to be effective in regulating blood glucose and insulin levels (71Trusted Source).\nThough the link between flax seeds and type 2 diabetes is still unclear, they may be considered a safe and healthy addition to your diet if you have type 2 diabetes (72Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds may modestly lower serum levels of sex hormones in overweight women, potentially decreasing breast cancer risk (78Trusted Source, 79Trusted Source).\nThey may also reduce fasting blood sugar in people with diabetes and lower your risk of several cancers.\nHowever, those with thyroid problems should consider avoiding high amounts of flax seeds (84Trusted Source).\nThough the safe upper limit of flaxseed intake has not been determined, one study concluded that 5 tablespoons (50 grams) per day is safe and beneficial for most healthy people (14Trusted Source).\nFor people who are not used to eating a lot of fiber, incorporating flax seeds too quickly can cause mild digestive problems.\nThough human studies are limited, many health professionals fear that consuming flax seeds during pregnancy may have undesirable effects.\nAnimal studies show that flax seeds and flaxseed lignans may cause lower birth weight and affect the development of the offspring\u2019s reproductive system \u2014 especially if consumed during early pregnancy (86Trusted Source, 87Trusted Source).\nLarge doses of omega-3 fatty acids may have blood-thinning effects (88Trusted Source).\nThey contain plant compounds that may adversely affect some people and are not considered safe for high-dose consumption in early pregnancy.\nFlax seeds have become popular due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and other plant compounds, which are responsible for many of the seeds\u2019 benefits.\nThey may aid weight loss and improve blood sugar control, as well as heart and digestive health.\nFlax seeds are packed with beneficial nutrients, omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.\nThis article explores 6 potential health benefits of flaxseed oil, plus how to use it."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/benefits-of-flaxseeds","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-flaxseed","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/flaxseeds"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
