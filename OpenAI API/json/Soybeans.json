soybeans have as an ingredient in our food and as a food source or animals, and how changes in the global trade of soy could harm environments in South America.\nA shopper who takes a closer look at the back of their box of cereal, crackers, canned soup or tuna, or any one of the many other packaged products, will frequently find the words \u201cContains Soy\u201d in bold black lettering underneath the listed ingredients While Americans consume large quantities of soy, the greatest demand for soy is for use as feed, made from soybean meal, for livestock and poultry.\nThe below illustration shows the breakdown of soybean uses: Globally, the greatest consumer of soy is China, which accounts for nearly \u2154 of global consumption.\nChinese production of these three forms of meat surged 250% from 1986 to 2012, drastically increasing China\u2019s importation of soybean meal by 815% since 2001.The United States is the greatest producer of soybeans producing 119.5 million metric tons last season.\nBrazil followed closely, with a production of 116.9 million metric tons in the 2017 harvest.\nHowever, this allocation is likely to change further, with US exports to China decreasing due to recent tariffs that will make US soybeans more expensive to Chinese buyers.\nSince US soy now costs more, Chinese farmers will look elsewhere, specifically Brazil, to buy cheaper soybeans.\nThere could be serious environmental consequences as China looks to South America to meet its soybean needs.\nSoy cultivation is likely to expand into new areas, leading to deforestation as natural environments are replaced with monocultures of Monsanto\u2019s GMO soybeans.\nThe landmass of the Cerrado is larger than Alaska and California combined, but only 8% of the biome is protected from agriculture or development, making it an easy target for extended cultivation of soybeans.As we have examined, the massive production of this crop, and use as food for ourselves and as food for animals contributes significantly to globalized trade.\nAs changes in supply and demand change, production and purchasing behaviors will also adjust, which could have serious environmental consequences in parts of South America.\nWe help conscious consumers easily buy the best products for their health & the planet ~ and offset the carbon footprint of every purchase by investing in clean energy and reforestry projects.","1":"","2":"Environmental Stress Conditions in Soybean Production: Soybean Production, Volume Two, examines the impact of conditions on final crop yield and

Benefits of Soybeans - Natural Food Series"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"In Asia, soybeans are often eaten whole, but heavily processed soy products are much more common in Western countries.\nVarious soy products are available, including soy flour, soy protein, tofu, soy milk, soy sauce, and soybean oil.\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of boiled soybeans are (1Trusted Source): Soybeans are among the best sources of plant-based protein.\nDespite causing unpleasant side effects in some people, soluble fibers in soybeans are generally considered healthy.\nThey are fermented by bacteria in your colon, leading to the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which may improve gut health and reduce your risk of colon cancer (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Soybeans contain higher amounts of isoflavones than other common foods (27Trusted Source).\nSome people possess a special type of gut bacteria that can convert daidzein to equol, a substance considered responsible for many of the beneficial health effects of soybeans.\nPeople whose bodies can produce equol are expected to benefit much more from soy consumption than those whose bodies cannot (28Trusted Source).\nSoybeans are a rich source of various bioactive plant compounds, including isoflavones, saponins, and phytic acid.\nLike most whole foods, soybeans have a number of beneficial health effects.\nEating soy products is linked to increased breast tissue in women, hypothetically increasing the risk of breast cancer (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nHowever, most observational studies indicate that consumption of soy products may reduce breast cancer risk (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nA number of soybean compounds \u2014 including isoflavones and lunasin \u2014 may be responsible for the potential cancer-preventive effects (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nStudies indicate that isoflavones, a family of phytoestrogens found in soybeans, may alleviate these symptoms (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nSoy only seems to be effective in so-called equol producers \u2014 those who possess a type of gut bacteria able to convert isoflavones into equol.\nDaily intake of 135 mg of isoflavones for 1 week \u2014 equivalent to 2.4 ounces (68 grams) of soybeans per day \u2014 reduced menopausal symptoms only in equol producers (45Trusted Source).\nWhile hormonal therapies have traditionally been used as a treatment for menopausal symptoms, isoflavone supplements are widely used today (46Trusted Source).\nConsumption of soy products may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in women who have undergone menopause (47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source).\nEven though soybeans have a number of health benefits, some individuals need to limit their consumption of soy products \u2014 or avoid them altogether.\nHigh intake of soy products may suppress thyroid function in some people and contribute to hypothyroidism \u2014 a condition characterized by low production of thyroid hormones (53Trusted Source).\nAnimal and human studies indicate that the isoflavones found in soybeans may suppress the formation of thyroid hormones (54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source).\nOne study in 37 Japanese adults showed that eating 1 ounce (30 grams) of soybeans every day for 3 months caused symptoms related to suppressed thyroid function.\nAnother study in adults with mild hypothyroidism found that taking 16 mg of isoflavones every day for 2 months suppressed thyroid function in 10% of the participants (55Trusted Source).\nThe amount of isoflavones consumed was rather small \u2014 equivalent to eating 0.3 ounces (8 grams) of soybeans per day (57Trusted Source).\nHowever, most studies in healthy adults have not found any significant links between soy consumption and changes in thyroid function (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source).\nAn analysis of 14 studies noted no significant adverse effects of soybean consumption on thyroid function in healthy adults, whereas infants born with thyroid hormone deficiency were considered at risk (58Trusted Source).\nIn short, regular consumption of soy products or isoflavone supplements may lead to hypothyroidism in sensitive individuals, especially those who have an underactive thyroid gland.\nLike most other beans, soybeans contain insoluble fibers, which may cause flatulence and diarrhea in sensitive individuals (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nEven though soybeans are one of the most common allergenic foods, soy allergy is relatively uncommon in both children and adults (61Trusted Source, 62Trusted Source).\nIn some people, soy products may suppress thyroid function, cause flatulence and diarrhea, and lead to allergic reactions.\nFor this reason, regular soybean intake may alleviate the symptoms of menopause and reduce your risk of prostate and breast cancer.","1":"Soybeans can be a rich source of fiber, antioxidants, protein, and omega 3 fatty acids.\nThey can offer a wealth of benefits such as improving metabolism, fighting obesity, protecting
