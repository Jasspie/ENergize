soluble and insoluble.\nThe insoluble fiber in millet is known as a \u201cprebiotic,\u201d which means it supports good bacteria in your digestive system.\nThe soluble fiber in millet can help reduce the amount of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol in your blood\u2014a risk factor for atherosclerosis.\nBecause cholesterol is such a big risk factor for heart disease, eating millet regularly may help keep your heart healthier.\nMillet is rich in potassium\u2014a mineral that supports healthy kidney and heart function.\nLike other grains, such as wheat or corn, millet is not a low-calorie food.\nYou should eat millet in moderation to help maintain a healthy weight.\nMillet is available in many supermarkets and health food stores in several different forms.\nGround millet makes a great substitute for, or addition to, whole wheat flour in baked goods.\nMillet in any form can be a healthy addition to most diets.","1":"While it may look like a seed, millet\u2019s nutritional profile is similar to that of sorghum and other cereals (2Trusted Source).\nMillet has gained popularity in the West because it\u2019s gluten-free and boasts high protein, fiber, and antioxidant contents (3Trusted Source).\nThis article reviews everything you need to know about millet, including its nutrients, benefits, and downsides.\nConsidered an ancient grain, it\u2019s used both for human consumption and livestock and bird feed (4, 5Trusted Source).\nMillet is a small cereal grain that belongs to the grass family.\nLike most cereals, millet is a starchy grain \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s rich in carbs.\nWhat\u2019s more, finger millet boasts the highest calcium content of all cereal grains, providing 13% of the DV per 1 cooked cup (100 grams) (4, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nWhile all millet varieties contain antioxidants, those with a darker color \u2014 such as finger, proso, and foxtail millet \u2014 have more than their white or yellow counterparts (13Trusted Source).\nMillet is rich in fiber and non-starchy polysaccharides, two types of undigestible carbs that help control blood sugar levels (10Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nThis cereal also has a low glycemic index (GI), meaning that it\u2019s unlikely to spike your blood sugar levels (8Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nFor instance, a study in 105 people with type 2 diabetes determined that replacing a rice-based breakfast with a millet-based one lowered blood sugar levels after the meal (21Trusted Source).\nAfter eating 1\/3 cup (50 grams) of foxtail millet per day, they experienced a slight reduction in fasting and post-meal blood sugar levels, as well as a decrease in insulin resistance (22Trusted Source).\nIt occurs when your body stops responding to the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar (23Trusted Source).\nWhat\u2019s more, in a 6-week study in rats with diabetes, a diet containing 20% finger millet led to lower fasting blood sugar levels and a drop in triglyceride and cholesterol levels (24Trusted Source).\nIn turn, this traps fats and helps reduce cholesterol levels (10Trusted Source).\nOne study in 24 rats found that those fed foxtail and proso millet had significantly reduced triglyceride levels, compared with the control group (25Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, millet protein may help lower cholesterol.\nA study in mice with type 2 diabetes fed them a high fat diet with millet protein concentrate.\nIts levels are usually lower in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nMillet is a gluten-free grain, making it a viable choice for people with celiac disease or those following a gluten-free diet (8Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nPeople with celiac disease or gluten intolerance must avoid it because it triggers harmful digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption (29Trusted Source).\nMillet is a gluten-free grain that\u2019s rich in antioxidants, soluble fiber, and protein.\nIn particular, it may lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\nDespite millet\u2019s multiple health benefits, it also contains antinutrients \u2014 compounds that block or reduce your body\u2019s absorption of other nutrients and may lead to deficiencies (31Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, you can lower millet\u2019s antinutrient content significantly by soaking it overnight at room temperature, then draining and rinsing it before cooking (4).\nIn fact, research suggests that making baked goods with millet flour significantly enhances their nutritional profile by increasing their antioxidant content (33Trusted Source).\nIn fact, fermented millet acts as a natural probiotic by providing live microorganisms that benefit your health (4, 8Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nMillet is a whole grain that\u2019s packed with protein, antioxidants, and nutrients.\nIt may have numerous health benefits, such as helping lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\nThis article takes a close look at grains and their health effects, both the good stuff and the\u2026 If you have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, it's important to avoid the protein gluten.\nHere are 14 healthy whole-grain foods to add to your\u2026 Ragi, or finger millet, is a nutrient-dense, versatile grain, but you may wonder whether it's suitable for people with diabetes.\nWhole grains have many legitimate health benefits.","2":"With a mild corn flavor that cooks similarly to rice or quinoa, millet pairs well in salads, as a side dish, as a porridge for breakfast, or even in breads and cakes.\nKeep reading to learn more about what is millet, the nutrition facts and benefits, and how to eat this healthy grain.\n\"Millet is a starchy, gluten-free grain that is packed with vitamins and minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium,\" says Samantha Murdoch, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\nThis cereal grain that looks like a seed has plenty of protein\u20146 grams per serving\u2014plus, lots of fiber, iron, and magnesium.\nYou can eat it as a breakfast porridge, drink it as a fermented beverage, use it as a substitute for rice, or toss it on salads.\nAccording to a study in Advances in Food and Nutrition Research, finger millet has the highest calcium and potassium content compared to other types of millet.\nMillet is one of the few grains that have a high protein content per serving, making it ideal for vegetarian, vegan, or plant-based diets.\n\"Millet is unique as it provides more essential amino acids compared to most cereals,\" says Allison Gregg, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\"Free radical damage contributes to the etiology of chronic health problems, such as cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases,\" Gregg says.\nThe grain's \"rich antioxidant content helps protect the body from oxidative stress resulting from free radicals,\" says\u00a0Kristin Gillespie, RD, a registered dietitian and certified nutrition support clinician based in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\"This, in turn, helps reduce the risk of several chronic conditions, including heart disease and certain types of cancer.\" The color of the grain also makes a difference.\n\"The darker the color of millet, such as finger and proso [varieties], the higher the antioxidant capabilities,\" says Gregg.\n\"Millet's rich fiber and non-starchy polysaccharides content help control blood sugar levels,\" says Gregg.\nNot only is millet beneficial in lowering cholesterol, but \"the rich antioxidant and fiber content of millet helps protect against chronic conditions, including heart disease and certain types of cancer,\" says\u00a0Gillespie.\nMillet is a naturally gluten-free cereal, making it ideal for anyone who wants to reduce the amount of gluten they consume or for those with celiac disease.\nAlthough it's a gluten-free whole grain, Gregg says \"that you should still look at the label when purchasing millet to ensure it is gluten-free and has not been contaminated with gluten-containing ingredients.\" Although millet has an array of health benefits, it's important to know that it has antinutrients.\nThere are different types of antinutrients and \"millet contains several, including tannins, phytates, polyphenols, trypsin inhibitors, and fiber,\" says Gillespie.\n\"Antinutrients are essentially plant-derived components that reduce the bioavailability\u2014and, therefore, absorptive capacity\u2014of certain nutrients,\" says Gillespie.\n\"While these antinutrients play a role in calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium absorption, there are various factors that may impact the amount of absorption,\" says Murdoch.\nIf you have, or are at risk for osteoporosis or iron deficiency anemia, for instance, \"it may be beneficial to have high iron or calcium-rich foods before or after consuming millet so the full extent of the nutrient is absorbed properly.\" Another concerning compound is goitrogenic polyphenols, which can affect the thyroid and cause goiter.\nYou can purchase millet in a variety of forms, including whole grain, millet grits, puffed, and flour.\n\"It can be cooked and eaten as a breakfast cereal similarly to oatmeal, cooked and utilized as a side dish, tossed into your salad, or even added to smoothies or protein shakes,\" Gillespie says."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-millet","1":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/what-is-millet","2":"www.msn.com\/en-us\/health\/nutrition\/what-is-millet-nutrition-facts-benefits-and-how-to-eat-it\/ar-BB1cZZtU"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
