Environmental benefits and impact assessment of oats in the UK","2":"Oats or milk is not the question - Resilience"},"environment_summaries":{"0":"Dairy consumers wondering about the environmental impact of oat milk, given its rapid rise, can rest assured it comes nowhere close to that of cows\u2019 milk.\nIn comparison to processing a grain like oats directly into plant milk, indirectly cycling crops through cows necessitates far more inputs, including highly-polluting pesticides and fertilizer.\nIn comparison to dairy, oat milk production emits less than one-third of the carbon and requires less than one-tenth of the land and water inputs.\nWhether the oats are grown elsewhere likely does little to change such stats, since most food emissions result from production, not transport.\nMisconceptions aside, in removing dairy and comparing the plant milks to one another, oat milk\u2019s carbon emissions are about average, and it requires the least water of all to produce\u2014about seven times less than almond milk and about five times less than rice milk.\nWhile all plant milks\u2019 ecological footprints pale in comparison to those of dairy, oat milk is among the most low-impact choices across the board.\nAlong with its reduced environmental footprint, oat milk\u2019s taste and nutrition may appeal to people who are unimpressed with other dairy alternatives.\nFrom a nutritional standpoint, like dairy, oat milk is often supplemented with Vitamin D, and, like other many plant-based milks, with calcium.\nOat milk may contain about half as much protein as skim dairy milk\u2014but given cattle farming\u2019s monstrous ecological footprint, protein can be consumed more sustainably through other lower-impact dietary sources like legumes.\nOat milk\u2019s rise may seem precipitous, but its popularity is good news for the environment.\nWhile consumers minimize their impact significantly by choosing any plant-based milk over dairy, oat is among the most consistently environmentally-friendly options.","1":"","2":"Two years ago I made a study on the the health and environmental effects of dairy products and plant-based alternatives, mainly oats and soy, to dairy under Swedish conditions.\nThe food system is dynamic and one cannot deduct the full environmental impact of choices of consumption from the results of lifecycle assessments.\nThe choice between milk and plant-based alternatives is less important than how the food system is designed and how they are produced.\nThey are useful for analysing a certain production to identify hot spots of environmental impact in order to direct improvements in a strategic way.\nThey can also be useful to compare two different ways of producing the same products, especially in an industrial context.\nAlong a similar vein, raising calves for slaughter and the slaughter of cows once they no longer produce milk are more or less a pre-condition for the production of milk.\nWhile individuals can choose oat drink or milk and not eat meat, at a system level meat consumption, and all its impacts, is embedded in both of them.\nFarming systems don\u2019t, hopefully, produce isolated products.\nOats and milk can be, and often are, produced on the same farm.\nFrom an agriculture and food systems perspective there simply are no reasons to position oat drink and milk as mutually exclusive alternatives.\nAnd the same person can prefer an oat creamer in their coffee while eating oatmeal porridge with milk.\nThe environmental and social effects of coffee production is more important than whether the coffee is mixed with milk, cream, or alternative creamers.\nBy exaggerating the importance of the choice between oat milk and milk, or between a vegan burger and a meat burger, the transformation of the food system is framed into a narrative of consumer choice.\nMilk, oats, soy, pork, avocado and oil palm can all be sustainably produced or not.\nGo for local foods produced in organic, regenerative ways, preferably by a farmer or a community you know, or produced by yourself.\nBut even more important be as little a consumer as possible, preferably not at all a consumer: be a food citizen, a food creator, a food producer.\nMeanwhile, agriculture policies, trade policies, tax systems and regulations are in many ways determining how food is produced and the conditions for farming and it is essential that citizens also engage in changing those conditions into the better."},"environment_urls":{"0":"sentientmedia.org\/what-oat-milks-rising-popularity-means-for-the-environment\/","1":"www.researchgate.net\/publication\/47541537_Environmental_benefits_and_impact_assessment_of_oats_in_the_UK","2":"www.resilience.org\/stories\/2021-01-19\/oats-or-milk-is-not-the-question\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

Benefits"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"Due to their many benefits, such as lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, oats have gained considerable attention as a health food (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4).\nThe majority of the fiber in oats is soluble, mostly a fiber called beta glucan.\nOats offer more soluble fiber than other grains, leading to slower digestion, increased fullness, and appetite suppression (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nSoluble oat beta glucans are unique among fibers, as they can form a gel-like solution at a relatively low concentration.\nOat beta glucans are known to lower cholesterol levels and increase bile acid production.\nThey\u2019re also believed to reduce blood sugar and insulin levels after a carb-rich meal (17, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20).\nDaily consumption of beta glucans has been shown to lower cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol, and may thus decrease your risk of heart disease (21Trusted Source).\nOats are a good source of quality protein at 11\u201317% of dry weight, which is higher than most other grains (22Trusted Source).\nHowever, pure oats are considered safe for most people with gluten intolerance (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nOats pack more protein and fat than most other grains and are a good source of beta glucan, a unique, soluble fiber linked to multiple health benefits.\nExperts attribute oats with a wide variety of health benefits, including lower blood pressure and reduced risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nStudies have repeatedly confirmed that oats can lower cholesterol levels, which may reduce your risk of heart disease (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).\nBeta glucan may slow your absorption of fats and cholesterol by increasing the viscosity of the food you\u2019ve eaten (55Trusted Source).\nBeta glucans, the soluble fibers from oats, have demonstrated benefits for blood sugar control (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).\nModest amounts of beta glucans from oats have been found to moderate both glucose and insulin responses after carb-rich meals (60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source, 62Trusted Source).\nIn people with type 2 diabetes and severe insulin resistance, a 4-week dietary intervention with oatmeal resulted in a 40% reduction in the insulin dosage needed for stabilizing blood sugar levels (63Trusted Source).\nPlus, oats are low in calories and high in fiber and other healthy nutrients, making them an excellent addition to an effective weight loss diet.\nOats are not glutenous but contain a similar type of protein called avenin.\nOats have been shown to enhance the nutritional value of gluten-free diets, increasing both mineral and fiber intakes (85Trusted Source, 86).\nTherefore, it is important for people with celiac disease to only eat oats that have been certified gluten-free.\nIn older adults, eating oat bran fiber may improve overall well-being and decrease the need for laxatives (91Trusted Source, 92Trusted Source, 93Trusted Source).\nOats offer a number of potential benefits, including reduced cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\nHowever, people sensitive to avenin may experience adverse symptoms, similar to those of gluten intolerance, and should exclude oats from their diet (94Trusted Source, 95, 96).\nAlso, oats may be contaminated with other grains, such as wheat, making them unsuitable for people with celiac disease or a wheat allergy (87Trusted Source, 88Trusted Source).\nOats are among the world\u2019s healthiest grains and a good source of many vitamins, minerals, and unique plant compounds.\nBeta glucans, a type of soluble fiber in this grain, provide numerous health benefits.\nThese include lower cholesterol, better heart health, and reduced blood sugar and insulin responses.\nEating oats and oatmeal has many benefits for weight loss and optimal health.\nThis article explores whether oats can be part of a gluten-free diet.","1":"They\u2019re a gluten-free whole grain and a great source of important vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.\nThese include weight loss, lower blood sugar levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.\nHere are 9 evidence-based health benefits of eating oats and oatmeal.\nOats are a whole grain that is commonly eaten for breakfast as oatmeal (porridge).\nThey also contain more protein and fat than most grains (4Trusted Source).\nOats are rich in carbs and fiber, but also higher in protein and fat than most other grains.\nMost notable is a unique group of antioxidants called avenanthramides, which are almost solely found in oats (6Trusted Source).\nAvenanthramides may help lower blood pressure levels by increasing the production of nitric oxide.\nThese compounds may help reduce blood pressure and provide other benefits.\nOats contain large amounts of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber.\nOats are high in the soluble fiber beta-glucan, which has numerous benefits.\nIt helps reduce cholesterol and blood sugar levels, promotes healthy gut bacteria and increases feelings of fullness.\nMany studies have shown that the beta-glucan fiber in oats is effective at reducing both total and LDL cholesterol levels (1Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nBeta-glucan may increase the excretion of cholesterol-rich bile, thereby reducing circulating levels of cholesterol in the blood.\nOne study reports that antioxidants in oats work together with vitamin C to prevent LDL oxidation (15Trusted Source).\nOats may lower the risk of heart disease by reducing both total and LDL cholesterol and protecting LDL cholesterol from oxidation.\nOats may help lower blood sugar levels, especially in people who are overweight or have type 2 diabetes (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nThese effects are mainly attributed to beta-glucan\u2019s ability to form a thick gel that delays emptying of the stomach and absorption of glucose into the blood (20Trusted Source).\nDue to the soluble fiber beta-glucan, oats may improve insulin sensitivity and help lower blood sugar levels.\nNot only is oatmeal (porridge) a delicious breakfast food \u2014 it\u2019s also very filling (21Trusted Source).\nBy delaying the time it takes your stomach to empty of food, the beta-glucan in oatmeal may increase your feeling of fullness (12Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nFor example, oat-based skin products may improve uncomfortable symptoms of eczema (28Trusted Source).\nColloidal oatmeal (finely ground oats) has long been used to help treat dry and itchy skin.\nMany researchers believe early introduction of solid foods may increase a child\u2019s risk of developing asthma and other allergic diseases (30Trusted Source).\nHowever, while they\u2019re effective, they\u2019re also associated with weight loss and reduced quality of life (34Trusted Source).\nStudies indicate that oat bran, the fiber-rich outer layer of the grain, may help relieve constipation in older people (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nOne trial found that well-being improved for 30 elderly patients who consumed a soup or dessert containing oat bran daily for 12 weeks (37Trusted Source).\nStudies indicate that oat bran can help reduce constipation in elderly individuals, significantly reducing the need to use laxatives.\nThat\u2019s because they may be harvested and processed using the same equipment as other grains that contain gluten (38Trusted Source).\nOats are an incredibly nutritious food packed with important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nOats contain some unique components \u2014 in particular, the soluble fiber beta-glucan and antioxidants called avenanthramides.\nBenefits include lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels, protection against skin irritation and reduced constipation.\nThis article takes a close look at grains and their health effects, both the good stuff and the\u2026 Oats are naturally gluten-free, but often get contaminated with gluten.","2":"With the rising popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, you may be wondering whether whole-grain breakfasts, like oatmeal, are still a healthy option.\nOats, in particular, are high in the form of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which is beneficial for heart health.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA\u00a0for 1\/2\u00a0cup dry (39g) rolled oats with no sugar or salt added.1\ufeff This serving is equivalent to 1 cup of cooked oatmeal (cooked in water).\nOats provide almost 30\u00a0grams of complex carbohydrates in one cup cooked.\nWith 4 grams of fiber and no added sugar, oats are a healthier choice than many processed breakfast cereals.2\ufeff The glycemic index of rolled oats is estimated to be about 57, and the glycemic load is 11.\nOatmeal is considered to be a moderately low glycemic food.\nThe fats in oatmeal are mostly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats with very little saturated fat.1\ufeff Oats are a good source of protein, providing about 5 grams per serving.\nOatmeal is a useful health food that provides both internal and external health benefits.\nNutrition experts suggest replacing refined grains, like white bread, pasta, bagels, or other breakfast pastries with whole-grain foods to promote satiety and healthy weight management.5\ufeff Plain oatmeal is a great alternative to less nutritious grain-based breakfast foods (like muffins and cereal made with refined grains).\nA review of 16 studies shows moderate benefits of oat consumption on type 2 diabetes management.7\ufeff A reduction in hemoglobin A1c values (a 3-month indicator of blood sugar levels) has been associated with oat intake, along with improvements in heart-health markers, a common co-morbidity.\nOats have more\u00a0soluble fiber\u00a0than most grains.\nSoluble fiber helps lower LDL cholesterol levels, particularly the type of fiber found in oatmeal, beta-glucan.8\ufeff Oats are naturally gluten-free and well-tolerated by the majority of people with celiac disease.\nHowever, oats are susceptible to cross-contamination with gluten-grains.\nChoosing brands that are specifically gluten-free and who follow a strict purity protocol reduces the risk of cross-contamination.9\ufeff According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), oat allergy symptoms may include itching to the mouth and throat and increased heart rate, although individual symptoms may vary.10\ufeff If you are allergic to oats, you may have to watch out for skincare products containing oatmeal, in addition to food products.\nDue to potential cross-contamination among grains during food processing, you may need to avoid oats if you have a known allergy to another grain.\nFor some people, increasing the intake of fiber from foods like oatmeal can cause uncomfortable gas and bloating.11\ufeff Although these symptoms are usually temporary, you can reduce these negative side effects by drinking plenty of water, staying physically active, and gradually adding in more fiber over a period of time rather than all at once.\nOats can be processed into a variety of oatmeal products.\nTypically, an increase in processing increases the oats's\u00a0glycemic index (how quickly it raises blood sugar).3\ufeff Popular oatmeal varieties include: Store dry oats in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place.\nTraditional oatmeal (rolled oats) can be consumed raw because bacteria are destroyed in the steam-press during processing.12\ufeff When cooking oatmeal over a hot stove or in the microwave, the quality is best when they are consumed right away, but cooked oats can be stored in the refrigerator and reheated.\nFollow the instructions on the package for proper cooking times based on the type of oatmeal you purchase.\nInstant oatmeal increases satiety and reduces energy intake compared to a
