Since the majority of the impacts associated with chicken-rearing come from producing their feed, one way to look at the question is as a matter of efficiency: Which type of bird does the best job turning the food it eats into the eggs we eat?\nData from Europe indicate that chickens raised in conventional cage systems\u2014the much-maligned \u201cbattery\u201d cages now being phased out in the European Union\u2014are the most efficient layers: It takes them about 2 kilograms of feed to produce 1 kilogram of eggs.\nChickens raised in cage-free or barn systems\u2014in which the birds are free to roam around the building but don\u2019t necessarily have access to the outdoors\u2014require about 14 percent more food.\nOrganic chickens, whose feed is grown without chemical fertilizers or pesticides, need roughly 20 percent more food than birds kept in cages.\n(For assistance decoding the dizzying variety of egg labels out there, see this  helpful guide from the New York Times.) The differences in feed efficiency arise in part because cage systems allow farmers to carefully calibrate the birds\u2019 temperature, so the animals expend less energy keeping themselves warm.\nFinally, in noncage systems, it\u2019s harder to regulate ammonia emissions from chicken poop\u2014a major issue of environmental concern on poultry farms.\n(Keep in mind that \u201cfree-range\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean that the hen spent its days frolicking in sun-kissed fields; it could mean the bird had some access to a concrete lot.) In addition, organic eggs may come with benefits that aren\u2019t necessarily reflected when you judge by efficiency alone\u2014like a reduction in pesticide and fertilizer applications, which is good for soil and water quality.\nWell, besides the happy, satisfied glow that comes from knowing where your food is produced, buying from a  well-managed small farm can have eco-benefits.\nBirds that are \u201cpasture raised\u201d\u2014i.e., that eat a lot of insects and grass alongside regular feed\u2014 produce eggs that may have health benefits, like  higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.\nBut for

can.","2":""},"environment_urls":{"0":"phys.org\/news\/2018-04-environmental-footprint-egg-industry.html","1":"slate.com\/technology\/2010\/06\/the-environmental-impact-of-eggs.html","2":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21177468\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"

are important for health.\nPeople who have higher levels of HDL usually have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and other health problems (10, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nEating eggs is a great way to increase HDL.\nIn one study, eating two eggs per day for six weeks increased HDL levels by 10% (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nA single egg contains more than 100 mg of this very important nutrient.\nIt is well known that having high levels of LDL is linked to an increased risk of heart disease (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nMany studies have shown that people who have predominantly small, dense LDL particles have a higher risk of heart disease than people who have mostly large LDL particles (20, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nEven if eggs tend to mildly raise LDL cholesterol in some people, studies show that the particles change from small, dense to large LDL, which is an improvement (23Trusted Source, 24).\nStudies show that consuming adequate amounts of these nutrients can significantly reduce the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, two very common eye disorders (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29).\nEgg yolks contain large amounts of both lutein and zeaxanthin.\nIn one controlled study, eating just 1.3 egg yolks per day for 4.5 weeks increased blood levels of lutein by 28\u201350% and zeaxanthin by 114\u2013142% (30Trusted Source).\nOmega-3 fatty acids are known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well known risk factor for heart disease (32, 33Trusted Source).\nStudies show that consuming omega-3 enriched eggs is a very effective way to lower blood triglycerides.\nIn one study, eating just five omega-3 enriched eggs per week for three weeks reduced triglycerides by 16\u201318% (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nEating enough protein can help with weight loss, increase muscle mass, lower blood pressure and optimize bone health, to name a few (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).\nMany studies published in recent years have examined the relationship between eating eggs and the risk of heart disease.\nOne review of 17 studies with a total of 263,938 participants found no association between egg intake and heart disease or stroke (40Trusted Source).\nHowever, some studies have found that people with diabetes who eat eggs have an increased risk of heart disease (43Trusted Source).\nWhether the eggs are actually causing the increased risk isn\u2019t known, because these types of studies can only show statistical association.\nOn a low-carb diet, which is by far the best diet for people with diabetes, eating eggs leads to improvements in risk factors for heart disease (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).\nEggs score high on a scale called the satiety index, which measures the ability of foods to cause feelings of fullness and reduce later calorie intake (47Trusted Source).\nIn one study of 30 overweight women, eating eggs instead of bagels for breakfast increased feelings of fullness and made them automatically eat fewer calories for the next 36 hours (48Trusted Source).\nIn another study, replacing a bagel breakfast with an egg breakfast caused significant weight loss over a period of eight weeks (49Trusted Source).\nStudies clearly show that eating up to three whole eggs per day is perfectly safe.\nDespite being high in cholesterol, eggs don't raise cholesterol in the blood.\nHere are 20 high protein foods that can help you lose weight, feel great, and gain\u2026 Some people avoid eggs due to allergies or dietary preferences.","1":"The content on Healthgrades does not provide medical advice.","2":"Although eggs are high in cholesterol, eating them has very little effect on blood cholesterol levels in most people.\nOne large egg (50 grams) has approximately 6.5 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, 0.5 gram of carbohydrate, and 70 calories.\nAdditionally, eggs are high in choline, an essential nutrient which has been linked to liver and brain health.\nEgg yolks also contain nutrients called carotenoids which may help protect eye health in some people.\nEggs are a convenient and delicious way to help meet your daily protein needs.\nThree large eggs provide about 19 grams of high-quality protein.\nOf course, the larger the egg, the more protein and nutrients it contains, too.\nRegardless of their size or the way they\u2019re prepared, eggs are a nutritious food you can enjoy regularly  \u2014 two, three, or more at a time \u2014 without keeping track of their calories.\nIn study after study, eggs have been shown to help people stay full for several hours after eating.\nEating foods high in protein like eggs can trigger the release of \u201cfullness hormones\u201d like GLP-1 and PYY.\nSo it makes sense that eating nourishing, filling foods like eggs that naturally reduce hunger could help you lose weight over time.\nAlso, limited research suggests that including eggs in a higher-protein diet may encourage fat loss and help preserve muscle.\nDecades ago, eggs earned a reputation for increasing heart disease risk because they\u2019re high in cholesterol.\nHowever, according to recent high-quality research, the opposite seems to be true: eating eggs may improve several markers of heart health.\nFrequent egg consumption has been shown to increase levels of HDL cholesterol (a marker linked to decreased heart disease risk) in healthy individuals and in those who are overweight or have diabetes.\nFor example, in studies of people following low-carb diets, those who ate whole eggs experienced greater insulin sensitivity and beneficial increases in HDL and LDL particle size compared to those who consumed a yolk-free egg substitute.\nIn addition, consuming whole eggs may improve HDL\u2019s ability to remove cholesterol from blood vessel walls in some people.\nFinally, contrary to previous thought, eating eggs several times a week seems to be perfectly safe for people who have heart disease or for those at increased risk of developing it.\nOf course, what you eat and drink with the eggs \u2014 and what you consume at other meals \u2014 can also affect heart health.\nIt\u2019s true that eggs are higher in cholesterol than most foods.\nHowever, eating eggs generally doesn\u2019t lead to higher levels of blood cholesterol.\nIn most people, eating more eggs prompts the body to produce less cholesterol, resulting in stable levels in the blood.\nIn studies of healthy adults, overweight individuals, and those with type 2 diabetes, most people\u2019s LDL cholesterol levels increased only slightly in response to eating more eggs.\nMany people are surprised to learn that eggs do not worsen the risk of heart disease, metabolic disease, or type 2 diabetes.\nEggs are one of the best examples of the complicated relationship between lower-quality scientific studies and media reports.\nThe vast majority of observational studies show that people who eat more eggs are less healthy at baseline, eat a lower-quality baseline diet, eat more calories, exercise less, and even smoke more cigarettes.\nStill other observational studies show just the opposite: that eating eggs is not associated with an increased risk of health complications, and in some cases may be linked to a decreased risk.\nUsing higher-quality evidence makes it clear that there is no scientific basis to fear eating eggs.\nIf properly refrigerated, eggs are unlikely to spoil, but their quality will diminish over time.\nStore eggs in their original carton on a shelf inside the refrigerator, away from any foods with odors.\nBoil these eggs and eat them within a few days.\nAlthough some eggs may be contaminated with salmonella, cooking them until both the yolk and white are firm will kill the bacteria.\nThe risk of bacterial contamination is relatively low in properly refrigerated eggs.\nHowever, eating raw or undercooked eggs is a common cause of food poisoning.\nCooking eggs makes their protein easier to digest.\nIn addition, raw egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which hinders your body\u2019s absorption of biotin (vitamin B7).\nBut eating eggs doesn\u2019t increase the risk of heart disease.\nOn the contrary, when included in a healthy diet, eggs may be beneficial for heart disease risk factors.\nEat whole eggs to get their maximum health benefits, flavor, and satisfaction."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/10-proven-health-benefits-of-eggs","1":"www.healthgrades.com\/right-care\/food-nutrition-and-diet\/7-powerful-health-benefits-of-eggs","2":"www.dietdoctor.com\/nutrition\/eggs"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":"
