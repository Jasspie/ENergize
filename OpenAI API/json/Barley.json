impacts of waste management for a brewery in the UK.\nResults show that valorising barley straw by this method generates a high environmental impact due to the energy requirements of the processes involved, principally for human toxicity (cancer effects), human toxicity (non-cancer effects) and freshwater ecotoxicity impact categories.\nThe analysis used in this paper allows an objective

Rice?"},"nutrition_summaries":{"0":"It\u2019s also rich in many nutrients and packs some impressive health benefits, ranging from improved digestion and weight loss to lower cholesterol levels and a healthier heart.\nWhen consumed as a whole grain, barley is a particularly rich source of fiber, molybdenum, manganese and selenium.\nAdditionally, barley packs lignans, a group of antioxidants linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart disease (3Trusted Source).\nThat\u2019s because soluble fibers, such as beta-glucan, tend to form a gel-like substance in your gut, which slows the digestion and absorption of nutrients.\nA review of 44 studies found that soluble fibers, such as beta-glucan, are the most effective type of fiber for reducing appetite and food intake (11Trusted Source).\nIn one four-week study in adult women, eating more barley improved bowel function and increased stool volume (14Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, barley\u2019s soluble fiber content provides food for friendly gut bacteria, which, in turn, produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).\nBarley\u2019s high fiber content may also help prevent gallstones.\nThe type of insoluble fiber found in barley may help prevent the formation of gallstones and reduce the likelihood of gallbladder surgery.\nIn one 16-year observational study, women with the highest amounts of fiber intake were 13% less likely to develop gallstones requiring gallbladder removal.\nThis benefit appears to be dose-related, as every 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped gallstone risk by around 10% (18Trusted Source).\nIn another study, obese individuals were put on one of two rapid weight loss diets \u2014 one rich in fiber, the other in protein.\nAfter five weeks, participants on the fiber-rich diet were three times likelier to have healthy gallbladders than those on the protein-rich diet (19Trusted Source).\nYour liver must then use up more cholesterol to make new bile acids, in turn lowering the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood (20Trusted Source).\nIn one small study, men with high cholesterol were put on a diet rich in whole wheat, brown rice or barley.\nAfter five weeks, those given barley reduced their cholesterol levels by 7% more than participants on the other two diets.\nWhat\u2019s more, the barley group also increased their \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and reduced their triglyceride levels the most (21Trusted Source).\nLab, animal and human studies also show that the SCFAs produced when healthy gut bacteria feed on soluble fiber may help prevent cholesterol production as well, further reducing cholesterol levels (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nThat\u2019s because barley may lower certain risk factors \u2014 in addition to reducing \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol levels, barley\u2019s soluble fiber may bring blood pressure levels down (25Trusted Source).\nIn fact, a recent review of randomized control studies observed that an average intake of 8.7 grams of soluble fiber per day may be linked to a modest 0.3\u20131.6 mmHg reduction in blood pressure (26Trusted Source).\nBarley may reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels and improving insulin secretion.\nThis is in part due to barley\u2019s rich magnesium content \u2014 a mineral that plays an important role in insulin production and your body\u2019s use of sugar (27Trusted Source).\nBarley is also rich in soluble fiber, which binds with water and other molecules as it moves through your digestive tract, slowing down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that a barley breakfast provides a lower maximum rise in blood sugar and insulin levels than a breakfast consisting of other whole grains, such as oats (30Trusted Source).\nAfter three months, fasting blood sugar and insulin levels decreased by 9\u201313% more for those eating barley (31Trusted Source).\nA diet rich in whole grains is generally linked to a lower likelihood of many chronic diseases, including certain cancers \u2014 especially those of the colon (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nIts insoluble fiber specifically helps reduce the time food takes to clear your gut, which appears particularly protective against colon cancers.\nDue to its high fiber content, barley can make a great alternative to more refined grains.\nIt\u2019s also high in fiber, which is responsible for most of its health benefits, ranging from a better digestion to reduced hunger and weight loss.","1":"Barley is one of the world's oldest grains, dating back more than 1,000 years to Southwest Asia where it was first farmed.\nCultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) is what you are likely to find on store shelves in modern times, but this grain was derived from a wild species (Hordeum spontaneum).\nIn the United States, barley production ranks fourth among cereal grains, behind corn, wheat, and rice.\nBarley is a versatile grain that can be used in salads, soups, or just served as a side dish.\nBarley provides fiber, protein, and micronutrients including selenium and niacin.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a one-cup serving (about 157g) of cooked, pearled barley.1\ufeff A one-cup serving of cooked, pearled, barley provides 193 calories, most of which are carbohydrates.\nYou'll consume 44.3 grams of carbohydrates in a single serving, 6 grams of fiber, and 0.4 grams of naturally-occurring sugar.\nOne cup of hulled barley (184g) provides 651 calories, 135 grams of carbohydrate, 31.8 grams of fiber, and 1.48 grams of naturally-occurring sugar, according to USDA data.2 A single cup of raw, hulled barley yields about 3 1\/2 of cooked barley.\nOne cup of pearled barley yields 4 cups cooked.\nBarley flour provides about 511 calories per cup (148g) serving.\nThere are 110 grams of carbohydrates, 14.9 grams of fiber, 15.5 grams of protein, and 1.18 grams of sugar in that serving size.3 The University of Sydney reports a glycemic index of 35 for pearled barley that has been boiled for 60 minutes.4 They also include barley with a glycemic index of 27 (making it a low glycemic food), but do not specify how or if it is cooked and whether or not it is pearled.5 There is less than one gram of fat (0.7 grams) in a single one-cup serving of boiled, pearled barley as long as no oil or butter is used in the cooking process.\nBarley contains about 3.6 grams of protein per one-cup cooked serving.\nAs a basis for comparison,\u00a0brown rice\u00a0provides about 4.5 grams of protein, quinoa provides about 8 grams per one-cup cooked serving, and Kamut provides 9.8 grams per one-cup serving.\nBarley is an excellent source of selenium, providing 13.5 micrograms or about 24.5% of the daily value (DV) set by the FDA that is used for food labels.\nMany studies conducted about the health effects of barley involve the whole grain (hulled) variety.\nIn a report published by New Zealand\u2019s Heart Foundation, researchers reviewed studies related to whole grain consumption.\nThis effect was seen when whole grains were consumed within the context of an energy-restricted diet or healthy dietary pattern.\nThey also noted that the soluble fiber in oats and barley has a greater beneficial effect on total and LDL cholesterol (3-8% reduction), especially in people with raised lipid levels.6\ufeff Barley is rich in dietary fiber, providing 6g per one-cup serving (as long as you choose the whole grain type).\nBarley's fiber content is higher than many other whole grains.\nOrganizations including the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health recommend that we make better efforts to consume the recommended dietary intake of fiber.7 In addition, the 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans has mentioned that fiber has been a nutrient of public health concern since 2005.\nThe current daily value for fiber provided by the FDA is 28 grams per day.8\ufeff Fiber can provide health benefits including improved blood glucose, improved blood cholesterol, and even a reduced risk of certain cancers.9\ufeff Some cereal grains are known to contain phenolic compounds due to their high antioxidant content.\nFree radicals occur naturally in the body, but we are also exposed to free radicals in the environment from things like air pollution or cigarette smoke.10 According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH),\u00a0oxidative stress\u00a0is thought to play a role in a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and eye diseases such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.10 The phenolic acid profile and antioxidant capacity of barley (along with wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, rye, oat, and millet) have been shown to provide health-promoting phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins.\nResearchers concluded that the presence of these natural antioxidants can play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.11 The fiber provided by barley can provide certain gastrointestinal benefits.\nA research review published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in 2012 found that increasing dietary fiber intake can increase stool frequency in those who have constipation.\nThat review, however, concluded that increased fiber intake did not improve stool consistency, constipation treatment success, laxative use, or painful defecation.12\ufeff But another study conducted in 2018 found that adding fiber to the diet in older adults may be effective in increasing stool frequency and\/or decreasing laxative use and reducing the burden of constipation.13\ufeff Barley is an excellent source of selenium, a nutrient that is important for reproduction and DNA production.\nSelenium also provides antioxidant benefits.14\ufeff Some preliminary research conducted at the University of Nebraska suggests that the short-term increased intake of whole grains, particularly whole grain barley, brown rice, or a mixture of the two, might promote healthy changes in the gut microbiota that coincide with improvements in systemic inflammation.\nThe researchers note that systemic in\ufb02ammation may be at the root of many chronic diseases.15\ufeff Barley, like wheat, contains cross-reactive proteins that can trigger allergic reactions (separate from gluten sensitivity).\nIf you are unsure if you might have a wheat or barley allergy, visit your healthcare provider to get personalized advice.17\ufeff Those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity cannot consume barely.\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\nIf you consume gluten containing grains and have either condition, you may experience symptoms including (but not limited to) unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, arthritis, or canker sores inside the mouth.18 If you avoid gluten you should also stay away from products made from barley, including malt.\nBecause part of the grain has been removed, pearled barley is not considered a whole grain.\nSome consumers prefer pearl barley because it cooks faster than whole-grain barley.\nIf you prefer a whole grain, look for hulled barley.\nThe grain (sometimes called dehulled barley) has had the tough, inedible, outer hull removed.\nThis removal process keeps the bran in tact so the barley is still considered a whole grain.\nBarley should be stored like you store all of your grains.\nOnce it is cooked, keep barley in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to three days.\nTo cook pearl barley, bring two quarts of water to a boil in a large pot on high heat.\nOnce the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the barley has reached your desired texture.\nTo prepare the grain, place one cup of the barley in a pot with about six cups of water and a dash of salt.\nBarley, pearled, cooked.\nUpdated 12\/6\/2019 Barley, pearled, boiled 60 min.\nFit More Fiber Into
