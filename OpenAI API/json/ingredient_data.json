it\u2019s better for the environment than white rice too.\nThe crazy thing is that these added steps to turn brown rice to white remove nutrients that are sometimes then introduced back in via synthetic sources \u2013 this is called fortified white rice.\nAdded to that, the dietary fiber contained in white rice is around a quarter of brown rice.\nThere\u2019s also the issue of the synthetic vitamins added back in \u2013 produced in laboratories and factories from a variety of chemicals; and these sorts of processes are well known for their negative impact on the environment.\nIf you\u2019re accustomed to white rice, making the switch to brown suddenly can cause a taste bud rebellion \u2013 it certainly did for me.\nOnce you\u2019ve acquired a taste for brown rice, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll never go back to white.\nAdded notes: A couple of readers have pointed out (thanks by the way!) that uncooked\u00a0brown rice doesn\u2019t keep for as long as white rice.","1":"The aim of this study is to investigate the prebiotic effects of brown rice fermented by Aspergillus oryzae (FBRA) on the intestinal environment in vitro and in healthy adults.\nFresh fecal slurries from six healthy adults were incubated with FBRA to confirm prebiotic potentials of FBRA.\nIncubation of fecal slurries with FBRA in vitro resulted in increased organic acids with individual-specific patterns.\nThe results in a clinical study indicated that FBRA could be safely used for healthy adults.","2":"Over time, the moist, nutrient-rich environment of brown rice can serve as a breeding ground for a variety of molds, bacteria and fungi.\nAccording to a 2007 report published in \"The Telegraph,\" rice contains potentially dangerous levels of arsenic if consumed in large quantities over time.\nBy purchasing organic rice, limiting your rice intake and eating a balanced diet, however, \"The Telegraph\" suggests that health issues associated with long-term arsenic consumption can be avoided.\nAs this fungus can grow on both cooked and uncooked rice, it is important to properly prepare rice and consume it as soon as possible after cooking to eliminate your risks of consuming aflatoxins.\nAlthough the risk of aflatoxin poisoning is relatively low, proper preparation, storage and health-conscious purchasing can help you to avoid many of the dangers associated with eating brown rice."},"environment_urls":{"0":"www.greenlivingtips.com\/articles\/brown-rice-vs-white-rice.html","1":"pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21921425\/","2":"www.livestrong.com\/article\/487110-brown-rice-dangers\/"},"environment_sentiment":{"0":"\n","1":"

rice, you can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 32%.\nScientists estimate that by replacing about 50 grams per day of white rice with brown rice, a person can reduce their diabetes risk by 16%.\nIt\u2019s a rich source of dietary fiber, which can reduce your risk of death from heart disease.\nBrown rice also contains high levels of magnesium, which can help make you less vulnerable to heart disease and stroke.\nOverall, studies show that eating more whole grains, including brown rice, could reduce your risk of heart disease by up to 22% and your risk of stroke by as much as 12%.\nAdding brown rice as a dietary staple may help people who are overweight to shed more pounds and reduce their body mass index, a common marker of healthy or unhealthy weight.\nBrown rice also contains more dietary fiber than white rice.\nIf you replace white rice with brown rice, you will be able to eat less without feeling hungrier.\nEuropean Journal of Epidemiology: \u201cWhole grain and refined grain consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies.\u201d Food Chemistry: \u201cPhytochemical profiles and antioxidant activity of brown rice varieties.\u201d Harvard T.","1":"Brown rice's health benefits are partially due to the way it is prepared, according to the George Mateljan Foundation for the\u00a0World\u2019s Healthiest Foods, which promotes the benefits of healthy eating.\nBrown rice is a whole grain, meaning that it contains three parts of the grain kernel: the outer, fiber-filled layer called the bran, the nutrient-rich core called the germ, and the starchy middle layer called the endosperm, according to the Harvard T.\nWhite rice, in contrast, is a refined grain, meaning that the bran and the germ have been removed, leaving just the endospore, HSPH says.\nSome of these nutrients \u2014including B vitamins and iron \u2014 are added back to \"enriched\" white rice, but fiber is not added back, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).\nAccording to HSPH, the fiber in brown rice helps lower cholesterol, moves waste through the digestive tract, promotes fullness, and may help prevent the formation of blood clots.\nBrown rice is considered a low \"glycemic index\" food.\nLow-GI foods have a rating of 55 or less; the average GI for brown rice is 55.\nAs a part of an overall healthy diet, whole grains may help improve cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, according to the AHA.\nIn 2012,\u00a0Consumer Reports\u00a0published an article stating that while arsenic is naturally present in a variety of foods, it is more likely to contaminate brown rice because brown rice absorbs a great deal of water while growing.\nHowever, the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0analyzed over 1,000 rice samples, and in 2014 stated, \"the arsenic levels that FDA found in the samples it evaluated were too low to cause any immediate or short-term adverse health effects.\" The FDA advised maintaining a diet that includes a variety of whole grains.\nBrown rice, like all grains, should be rinsed thoroughly under running water, and any dirt or debris should be removed.\nTo cook brown rice, add one part rice to two parts boiling water or broth.\nBrown rice takes longer to cook than white rice because the fibrous bran layer and nutrient-rich germ layer have been removed, HSPH says.","2":"In moderation, brown rice can be a very nutritious\u00a0gluten-free carbohydrate and healthy rice choice overall.\nBrown rice nutrition doesn\u2019t have too many calories per serving, but the\u00a0nutrient content certainly is up there, whether we\u2019re talking brown rice eaten on its own or brown rice protein powder.\nRice nutrition is actually an important topic since about half of the world\u2019s inhabitants (especially East and Southeast Asia) is completely reliant on rice as a staple food in their daily diets.\nRefined carbohydrates like white rice are basically fake foods and\u00a0do nothing to promote the health of your body.\nBrown rice nutrition, on the other hand, is loaded with vitamins and minerals as well as fiber and protein to balance\u00a0the carbs in brown rice.\nScientific studies has even shown that brown rice nutrition can\u00a0reduce the risk of developing diabetes as well as heart problems.\nIt\u2019s also a safe choice for anyone following a gluten-free diet.\nStudies also demonstrate\u00a0that getting your magnesium from your diet rather than supplements is likely preferable, especially for people who have already suffered heart attacks in the past.\nOne of the most impressive attributes of brown rice nutrition is its extremely high manganese content per\u00a0serving.\nManganese isn\u2019t talked about as much as some other nutrients, but it\u2019s extremely important to optimal health.\nIt\u2019s an important trace mineral needed for many vital functions, including nutrient absorption, production of digestive enzymes, bone development, formation of blood-clotting factors and immune system defenses.\n(6) Whole grain foods like brown rice contain both fiber and bran.\nThis is why brown rice offers so many more health benefits than white rice \u2014\u00a0it still has its bran content.\nStudies have shown that the rice bran and fiber contained in brown rice may be able to lower unhealthy cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol.\n(7) Scientific research has shown that opting for brown rice instead of white rice may actually decrease your risk of developing\u00a0diabetes.\nA 2010\u00a0study out of Harvard School of Public Health\u00a0revealed that if you consume\u00a0a little over two servings of white rice (about 12 ounces) per week, making the switch to brown rice could decrease type 2 diabetes risk by an estimated\u00a016 percent.\n(8) This\u00a0isn\u2019t to say that white rice causes diabetes, but brown rice definitely appears to lower the risk of developing diabetes, thus making it a better choice for anyone following a diabetic diet plan.\nSimilar to oatmeal, brown rice is a naturally gluten-free food as long as it\u2019s not contaminated by gluten-containing substances.\n(9) Many people who avoid gluten in their diets can easily fall short on fiber and the beneficial B vitamins found in whole grains.\nBrown rice nutrition facts are quite impressive and definitely beat white rice nutrition any day.\nWhen brown rice is further processed to remove the bran as well, then it becomes white rice and loses most of its nutrients as a result of this processing.\nHighlights of brown rice nutrition include high amounts of manganese, selenium, magnesium, phosphorus and B vitamins.\nA half cup of cooked brown rice only contains a little over 100\u00a0calories, and brown rice nutrition is plentiful.\n(12) Unless white rice is enriched, it really doesn\u2019t offer the consumer much of anything in terms of nutrients so white rice nutrition is basically nonexistent.\nHowever, the less popular black rice aka \u201cforbidden rice\u201d is actually even more impressive than brown rice nutrition, but it does contain a lot more calories for the same serving.\nThese whole grain rices are naturally high in B vitamins and other nutrients.\nWhite rice, however, has to\u00a0have B vitamins added into it in order to provide any white rice nutrition.\nSince brown rice still has the\u00a0healthy natural oils of the germ, it also has a shorter shelf life compared to white rice.\nI also highly recommend soaking and sprouting your brown rice before cooking it, which has been found to\u00a0decreases allergens\u00a0and phytic acid content\u00a0while increasing the absorption of nutrients.\nBrown rice generally needs more cooking time than white rice.\n(Kind of how you would cook pasta \u2014 six to 10 parts water per one part rice.) Scientists proved this method could reduce arsenic levels, especially inorganic arsenic, in rice by up to 40 percent.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and healthy recipes in the world...Sign up to get VIP access to his eBooks and valuable weekly health tips for FREE!"},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/health-benefits-brown-rice","1":"www.livescience.com\/50461-brown-rice-health-benefits-nutrition-facts.html","2":"draxe.com\/nutrition\/brown-rice-nutrition\/"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 90","1":" 70","2":" 50"},"categories":{"0":"Grains","1":"Gluten-Free","2":null}}
