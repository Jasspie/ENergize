for several biological processes, such as regulating blood pressure, metabolism and bone health (2, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nVitamin D promotes bone and immune system health and may reduce the risk of some diseases, including heart disease and depression (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nIt may automatically reduce the number of calories you consume overall, which is beneficial for weight control (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nIn one study, subjects who snacked on yogurt were less hungry and consumed 100 fewer calories at dinner, compared to those who ate lower-protein snacks with the same amount of calories (14Trusted Source).\nSome types of yogurt contain live bacteria, or probiotics, that were either a part of the starter culture or added after pasteurization.\nThese may benefit digestive health when consumed (17Trusted Source).\nOne study had IBS patients regularly consume fermented milk or yogurt that contained Bifidobacteria.\nAnother study found that yogurt with Bifidobacteria improved digestive symptoms and health-related quality of life among women who did not have a diagnosed digestive condition (22Trusted Source).\nSome types of yogurt contain probiotics, which may boost digestive health by reducing the symptoms of common gastrointestinal disorders, such as bloating, diarrhea and constipation.\nWe\u2019ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Consuming yogurt \u2014 especially if it contains probiotics \u2014 on a regular basis may strengthen your immune system and reduce your likelihood of contracting an illness.\nYogurt provides probiotics, vitamins and minerals, all of which may boost immune health and prevent certain illnesses.\nYogurt contains some key nutrients for maintaining bone health, including calcium, protein, potassium, phosphorus and, sometimes, vitamin D.\nHowever, research shows that consuming at least three servings of dairy foods, such as yogurt, on a daily basis may help preserve bone mass and strength (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source).\nYogurt is rich in vitamins and minerals that play a key role in bone health.\nSome research shows that the intake of saturated fat from whole-milk products increases \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, which may protect heart health.\nOther studies have found yogurt intake to reduce the overall incidence of heart disease (55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, dairy products like yogurt have been shown to help reduce high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.\nRegardless of its fat content, yogurt appears to benefit heart health by increasing \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and reducing blood pressure.\nFor starters, it is high in protein, which works along with calcium to increase levels of appetite-reducing hormones like peptide YY and GLP-1 (61Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, several studies have found that yogurt consumption is associated with lower body weight, body fat percentage and waist circumference (62Trusted Source).\nOne review found that the intake of full-fat dairy products, including yogurt, may reduce the incidence of obesity.\nSome people need to be cautious with their yogurt intake, as it may cause adverse effects, especially in those with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.\nThis is because some of the lactose is broken down during production, and probiotics may assist with its digestion (66Trusted Source).\nMilk products contain casein and whey, which are proteins that some people are allergic to.\nMany types of yogurt contain high amounts added sugar, especially those labeled as low in fat.\nYogurt may have adverse effects for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergies.\nMany types also contain high amounts of added sugar, which may contribute to certain health conditions.\nPlain, unsweetened varieties are best, since they contain minimal ingredients without any added sugar.\nYou should also look for yogurts that contain live and active cultures to ensure you get your fix of health-promoting probiotics.\nThe best yogurts for your health contain few ingredients and no added sugar.\nYogurt is rich in nutrients and may boost your health when consumed regularly.\nIt may help reduce the risk of some diseases, while also benefiting digestive health and weight control.\nFor maximal health benefits, choose plain, unsweetened varieties that contain probiotics.\nEating fermented foods with live probiotics can have powerful benefits for your body and brain.\nLactose-intolerant people don't have to avoid all dairy products.\nKefir is a fermented milk drink that is highly nutritious and contains live probiotics.\nDairy is the best source of calcium in the diet, the main mineral in bones.","1":"Miguel Freitas, PhD, medical marketing manager for Dannon Co., says the benefits associated with probiotics are specific to certain strains of these \"good\" bacteria.\n(Keep in mind that the only yogurts that contain probiotics are those that say \"live and active cultures\" on the label.) And let us not forget that yogurt comes from milk.\nSo yogurt eaters will also get a dose of animal protein (about 9 grams per 6-ounce serving), plus several other nutrients found in dairy foods, like calcium, vitamin B-2, B-12, potassium, and magnesium.\nHere are five possible health benefits of having a yogurt a day: ''Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D,'' says Jeri Nieves, PhD, MS, director of bone density testing at New York\u2019s Helen Hayes Hospital.\nCalcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass in people of all ages, although the results are not always consistent, says Nieves, also an assistant professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University.\nCurrently, 400 IU per day is considered an adequate intake of vitamin D for people ages 51-70, Nieves says.\nNieves believes that older people specifically can benefit from more vitamin D.\nMany dairy products, including some yogurts, are made with added vitamin D.\nFind out which brands have added vitamin D by checking out the table below, and by reading labels when you shop.\nAlthough most of the low-fat dairy consumed by the study subjects was as milk, Alvaro believes low-fat yogurt would likely have the same effect.\nA recent Taiwanese study looked at the effects of yogurt containing lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on 138 people with persistent H.\nIn a small study, seven diabetic women with chronic Candidal vaginitis consumed 6 ounces of frozen aspartame-sweetened yogurt per day (with or without active cultures).\nEven though most of the women had poor blood sugar control throughout the study, the vaginal pH (measure of acidity or basicity) of the group eating yogurt with active cultures dropped from 6.0 to 4.0 (normal pH is 4.0-4.5).\nThe women eating the yogurt without active cultures remained at pH 6.0.\n1.5 1.5 7.5 1.5 1.5 The other decision is whether you want artificial sweeteners (which are used in most ''light'' yogurts) or whether you\u2019re OK with most of the calories coming from sugar.\nTo make sure your yogurt contains active cultures, check the label.\nMost brands will have a graphic that says ''live and active cultures.'' If you want to know which specific active cultures your yogurt contains, look to the label again.\nUnder the list of ingredients, many brands list the specific active cultures.\nThis particular yogurt contains the probiotic culture bifidus regularis, which works to regulate your digestive system.\nSome brands list 0% of the Daily Value for vitamin D; others have 20%.\n(See the table above.) Make the perfect snack by pairing high-protein yogurt with a high-fiber food like fruit (fresh or frozen) and\/or a high-fiber breakfast cereal.\nCup for cup, light and low-fat yogurt is higher in protein and calcium than light ice cream.\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition,\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition, April 2006; vol 83: pp 864-869.\nJournal of the American Dietetic Association, April 2006; vol106, Issue 4:","2":"Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented dairy products in the world, made by adding live bacteria to milk.\nIn addition, yogurt contains beneficial bacteria and may function as a probiotic, providing a variety of health benefits above and beyond plain milk.\nThe nutrients in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of plain, whole-milk yogurt are detailed below (1Trusted Source).\nThe protein content of commercial yogurt is sometimes higher than in milk because dry milk may be added to yogurt during processing (2Trusted Source).\nProtein in yogurt is either whey or casein, depending on its solubility in water.\nIn addition, consumption of whey protein supplements may provide various health benefits, promoting weight loss and lower blood pressure (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nThe amount of fat in yogurt depends on the type of milk it\u2019s made from.\nYogurt may have even more CLA than milk (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nHowever, the lactose content of yogurt is lower than in milk.\nThe glucose is mostly converted to lactic acid, the substance that contributes the sour flavor to yogurt and other fermented milk products (15Trusted Source).\nYogurt is a great source of high-quality protein, offers various amounts of fat, and contains small amounts of lactose.\nThese friendly bacteria are found in fermented milk products, such as yogurt with live and active cultures (21Trusted Source).\nThe main probiotics in fermented milk products are lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (22).\nYogurts with live and active cultures contain probiotic bacteria that may improve digestive health.\nThe health effects of milk and fermented dairy products like yogurt have been widely studied.\nProbiotic yogurt can provide numerous impressive health benefits that go well beyond that of non-fermented milk.\nProbiotic yogurt is associated with a variety of digestive health benefits.\nRegular consumption of yogurt with live and active cultures may help treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea by restoring balance in your intestinal flora (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).\nIn fact, dairy is associated with higher bone density, an effect linked to its high calcium and protein content (19Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).\nStudies suggest that regular consumption of yogurt may lower blood pressure in people who already have high readings (46Trusted Source).\nConsumption of probiotic yogurt may improve gut health, reduce your risk of osteoporosis, and combat high blood pressure.\nYogurt may cause adverse effects in certain people \u2014 especially in anyone who\u2019s lactose intolerant or allergic to milk proteins.\nYogurt contains less milk sugar (lactose) than milk.\nThat\u2019s because some of the lactose in milk breaks down into glucose and galactose during yogurt production.\nHowever, probiotic bacteria may also help by improving your ability to digest lactose (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nNotably, lactose-intolerant individuals tolerate yogurt with added lactose better than milk with the same amount of lactose (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source).\nIt is triggered by the milk proteins \u2014 whey and casein \u2014 found in all milk products (51Trusted Source).\nYogurt may pose health risks for anyone with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.\nYogurt is a dairy product made by fermenting milk.\nNatural probiotic yogurt with live and active cultures is one of the healthiest dairy products, especially when it\u2019s free of added sugar.\nYogurt is incredibly healthy, offering benefits for heart health, weight management and more."},"nutrition_urls":{"0":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/7-benefits-of-yogurt","1":"www.webmd.com\/diet\/features\/benefits-of-yogurt","2":"www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/foods\/yogurt"},"nutrition_sentiment":{"0":" 70","1":" 70","2":" 90"}}
