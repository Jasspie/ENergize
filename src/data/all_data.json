        "1": "Also, 99% of the total production of almonds comes from California.\nAs California is in a current drought, and the fact that almonds require 10% of California’s total water supply each year, one could say that this statistic is astounding.\nThe effect of the amount of water required for almonds must be relatively compared, like all products.\nThis is exemplified by comparing the amount of water required to produce 1 gram of protein from almonds and beef.\nFor almonds, 1 gram of protein requires 4 gallons of water, while for 1 gram of beef; 27 gallons of water are needed.\nAs for water amount, it takes 6 times less the amount of water to produce protein out of almonds than it is from beef.\nI have always looked at almonds as a healthier option, but I never realized how much water it takes to produce them.\nFrom what you have highlighted, it seems that the extent to which California produces Almonds, proves unsustainable long term.\nAs soon as you compared it to how many loads of laundry you could do, I was really able to visualize how much water is actually being wasted to produce almond milk.\nWhile it is shocking to see the statistics behind the water needed to grow a single almond, I still wonder whether people will be willing to change their habits.",
        "2": "Dr. Brodt showed how Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was increasingly being used by the food industry and policy makers as a comprehensive tool for measuring environmental sustainability in food production by using several crops as case studies, including California almonds.\nThe study, published in The Journal of Industrial Ecology[i], is the most exhaustive food life cycle assessment study to date by the university’s researchers, and it demonstrates the complexity of agricultural systems and prospects for significant environmental benefits.\nThe Californian almond industry is being utilized as an important case study to highlight the potential for supply chain sustainability.”  “The food industry and policy makers can use Life Cycle Assessments as a comprehensive tool for measuring environmental sustainability in food production and this is an area that requires ongoing research as environmental conditions and regulations change.\nThis is a key area of focus as updating the LCA modelling research is already underway with greater emphasis on the co-products and surface and groundwater usage.” Current research from the California Almond Sustainability Program shows that 74 percent of almond growers use orchard prunings (tree wood, bark, clippings and other materials) for in-orchard chipping, composting, or energy generation.\n[i] Elias Marvinney, Alissa Kendall, Sonja Brodt, Weiyuan Zhu.

        "0": "Its alleged health benefits include lower blood sugar levels and improved digestion, heart health, and liver health.\nA medium artichoke (128 grams raw, 120 grams cooked) contains (1Trusted Source): Artichokes are low in fat while rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nArtichoke leaf extract may have a positive effect on cholesterol levels (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nA large review in over 700 people found that supplementing with artichoke leaf extract daily for 5–13 weeks led to a reduction in total and “bad” LDL cholesterol (6Trusted Source).\nOne study in 143 adults with high cholesterol showed that artichoke leaf extract taken daily for six weeks resulted in an 18.5% and 22.9% decrease in total and “bad” LDL cholesterol, respectively (7Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, an animal study reported a 30% reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol and a 22% reduction in triglycerides after regular consumption of artichoke extract (8Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, regularly consuming artichoke extract may boost “good” HDL cholesterol in adults with high cholesterol (5Trusted Source).\nSecond, artichoke leaf extract encourages your body to process cholesterol more efficiently, leading to lower overall levels (8Trusted Source).\nOne study in 98 men with high blood pressure found that consuming artichoke extract daily for 12 weeks reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by an average of 2.76 and 2.85 mmHg, respectively (10Trusted Source).\nHowever, test-tube and animal studies indicate that artichoke extract promotes the enzyme eNOS, which plays a role in widening blood vessels (9Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nThat said, it is unclear whether consuming whole artichokes provides the same benefits, as the artichoke extract used in these studies is highly concentrated.\nIn one study, artichoke extract given to rats resulted in less liver damage, higher antioxidant levels, and better liver function after an induced drug overdose, compared to rats not given artichoke extract (16Trusted Source).\nFor example, one trial in 90 people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease revealed that consuming 600 mg of artichoke extract daily for two months led to improved liver function (17Trusted Source).\nIn another study in obese adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, taking artichoke extract daily for two months resulted in reduced liver inflammation and less fat deposition than not consuming artichoke extract (18).\nScientists think that certain antioxidants found in artichokes — cynarin and silymarin — are partly responsible for these benefits (14Trusted Source).\nArtichokes are a great source of fiber, which can help keep your digestive system healthy by promoting friendly gut bacteria, reducing your risk of certain bowel cancers, and alleviating constipation and diarrhea (23, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nIn one study, 12 adults experienced an improvement in gut bacteria when they consumed an artichoke extract containing inulin each day for three weeks (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nA study in 247 people with indigestion determined that consuming artichoke leaf extract daily for six weeks reduced symptoms, such as flatulence and uncomfortable feelings of fullness, compared to not taking artichoke leaf extract (29Trusted Source).\nCynarin, a naturally occurring compound in artichokes, may cause these positive effects by stimulating bile production, accelerating gut movement, and improving the digestion of certain fats (9Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nIn one study in people with IBS, consuming artichoke leaf extract daily for six weeks helped ease symptoms.\nAnother study in 208 people with IBS discovered that 1-2 capsules of artichoke leaf extract, consumed daily for two months, reduced symptoms by 26% and improved quality of life by 20% (20Trusted Source).\nWhile artichoke extract seems promising for treating IBS symptoms, larger human studies are needed.\nArtichokes and artichoke leaf extract may help lower blood sugar levels (9Trusted Source).\nOne study in 39 overweight adults found that consuming kidney bean and artichoke extract daily for two months lowered fasting blood sugar levels compared to not supplementing (30Trusted Source).\nAnother small study indicated that consuming boiled artichoke at a meal reduced blood sugar and insulin levels 30 minutes after eating.\nCertain antioxidants — including rutin, quercetin, silymarin, and gallic acid — in artichokes are thought responsible for these anticancer effects (9Trusted Source).\nFor example, silymarin was found to help prevent and treat skin cancer in animal and test-tube studies (36Trusted Source).\nHowever, typical doses used in human research range from 300–640 mg of artichoke leaf extract three times daily (7Trusted Source).\nRegular consumption of artichoke extract may aid cholesterol levels, blood pressure, liver health, IBS, indigestion, and blood sugar levels.",
        "1": "Artichoke extract supplements — which provide a concentrated dose of the veggie’s protective compounds, including chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin and cymaroside — have also been shown to have cholesterol-lowering and disease-fighting effects.\nDue to its high fiber quantity and phytonutrients, artichoke nutrition has a strong tie to preventing serious conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, as well as having positive effects on liver and digestive health.\nThe name artichoke comes from the  word articiocco, which is most likely influenced by the word ciocco, meaning “stump.” The globe artichoke — the kind most often eaten today — is from the thistle species, a group of flowering plants characterized by leaves with sharp prickles on their margins.\nSome noteworthy artichoke health benefits include having a high antioxidant content that may help prevent cancer, manage weight, and control blood sugar and diabetes — plus their ability to provide a good source of fiber and other nutrients.\nIn fact, artichoke extract supplements, which have become more popular over recent years due to their various heart health-promoting benefits, are largely derived from antioxidants and phytonutrients found in the leaves of this vegetable.\nLeaf extracts of the artichoke plant are used for their liver (hepato) protectant properties and also have anti-carcinogenic, antioxidative, antiviral and antibacterial effects.\nThe nutritional value of artichokes is also impressive considering one only provides about 60 calories but over 10 percent of your daily needs of six different essential nutrients.\nArtichokes are a high-antioxidant food and have a high ORAC score (oxygen radical absorption capacity), which tests the power of a plant to absorb and eliminate free radicals.\nCompounds present in artichokes — specifically rutin, quercetin and gallic acid — have been shown in studies to reduce the growth of cancerous cells and therefore prevent cancerous tumors from proliferating.\nResearch published in both the Journal of Cellular Physiology and Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity found that polyphenolic extracts from the edible parts of artichokes “induce apoptosis and decrease the invasive potential of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231.” Another study conducted by the National Research Centre’s Medicinal Chemistry Department in Dokki Giza, Egypt, looked at the protective effects of fish oil and artichokes on hepatocellular carcinoma in rats.\nThe researchers concluded after dividing the rats into eight groups, “the results pointed that 10% fish oil and 1 g% leaves of artichoke succeeded to protect from hepatocellular carcinoma to a certain degree.\nIn addition, they may be considered as protective foods against angiogenesis.” Consuming artichokes and artichoke extract has been correlated with reductions in unhealthy cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome.\nArtichoke nutrition may also help calm inflammation in the body and improve blood flow.\nLuckily the powerful substance cynarin found in artichoke nutrition is one of the best natural remedies for bringing cholesterol back to a healthy level.\nResearch shows that the lipidic- and glycemic-reducing action of artichokes also help them prevent coronary heart disease and metabolic disorders.\nThe cholesterol-lowering effects of artichoke hearts can be attributed mainly to its soluble fibers, particularly the kind called inulin.\nOne double-blind, randomized controlled trial also found that supplementing with artichoke leaf extract reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.\nArtichoke extract and juice have also been shown to fight high blood pressure/hypertension.\nBecause of their ability to boost the production of digestive bile and to detox the body, artichokes are included on the GAPS diet plan protocol, which is a diet that was specifically created to nourish the digestive tract and restore proper gut health.\nEating GAPS diet-approved foods like artichokes is correlated with improving gut flora, reducing symptoms related to digestive disease and boosting immunity — since much of the immune system is actually held within the gut.\nArtichokes may even be able to help liver cells regenerate.\nA 2018 study found that artichoke extract supplementation increases antioxidant status in the liver, including levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase.\nAnother substance in artichoke nutrition called cynarin has also been shown to positively stimulate the production of bile, which is produced by the liver and ultimately responsible for enabling digestion and helping with the absorption of nutrients.\nIt’s believed that the artichoke benefits IBS and other digestive disorders because of its high fiber content, ability to reduce inflammation, and artichoke’s nourishing effect on the gut lining and liver.\nOne study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine also found that artichoke leaf extract can be very helpful in relieving symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the leading digestive disorders in the world.\nArtichokes are very high in fiber, which is crucial for numerous functions in the body.\nStudies have shown that consuming plenty of soluble fiber, like the kind found in artichoke nutrition, is a great way to keep off dangerous visceral fat — the kind that accumulates around your organs and can lead to various diseases.\nA diet high in fiber is correlated with maintaining a healthy weight and also reducing the risk for serious conditions, including colon cancer, heart disease and more.\nArtichokes nutrition may help with weight loss because it has the ability to swell and expand in your stomach and intestines, soaking up fluid and giving you the feeling of being full.\nThe high amount of fiber found in artichoke nutrition means artichokes can help normalize blood sugar levels , avoiding spikes and dips in insulin that can lead to serious problems for diabetics.\nThe fiber in artichoke nutrition allows glucose to be absorbed in the blood more slowly, and because fiber is a substance that can be digested and does not require insulin, fiber does not count toward the amount of carbohydrates or glucose you consume.\nOne animal study found that supplementation with artichoke extract helped prevent adiposity and related metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammation.\nWhile many people think of animal products, like beef and eggs, as the only and best sources of iron, artichokes are also a good source, especially for plant-based eaters who need to make sure they consume enough of the vital mineral.\nArtichoke benefits for skin include supporting your immune system and supplying antioxidants that fight free radicals.\nThe artichoke should be a healthy green color, and it should look fresh, not dehydrated.\nThis means that the artichoke is fresh, and it will be tender when eating.\nIn order to keep your artichoke fresh, it needs to be stored properly.\nIt’s best to cook the artichoke within a week of buying it if possible.\nBefore eating an artichoke, remove the purple part using a knife, since under the purple leaves is the fuzzy, grayish-brown choke that is edible.\nThese are a healthy addition to your diet but have a higher sodium content than fresh artichokes, as do canned hearts.\nThe taste seems to depend on how you cook artichokes and the specific type.\nThe most complementary ingredients for an artichoke include olive oil, lemon, parsley, rosemary, high-quality cheeses, red onion, arugula, salt and pepper.\nStart by pulling off a petal from the cooked inside part of the artichoke.\nOnce you consume all of the petals, remove the fuzzy layer that’s covering the heart of the artichoke.\nBy increasing the bile flow in the body, gallstones may become worse, so if you suffer from gallstones, use precaution when consuming artichokes.",
        "2": "When steamed, artichokes have a tender texture and a sweet, earthy taste that make them an excellent addition to dips and sauces, as well as a perfect stand-alone snack.\nOne study showed that artichoke leaf juice helped regulate blood pressure for people with mild high blood pressure.\nThough studies are still in their early stages, researchers believe that the high levels of potassium in artichokes may be a contributing factor to this effect.\nEarly studies suggest that artichoke leaf extract may help lower cholesterol levels.\nBecause research on these effects have been limited and the sample sizes were relatively small, however, artichokes are not yet being recommended as a treatment for high cholesterol.\nA few small studies have shown that artichoke can improve liver function for people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nThough there’s no data yet about its effect on alcoholic fatty liver disease, there’s evidence that artichoke leaf extract can contribute to overall liver health.\nOnce your artichoke has been steamed, you have a few different options for eating it.\nSome people choose to peel away the petals of the artichoke and only eat the center, or \"heart.” However, some of the best nutrients are concentrated in the leaves.\n\"Artichoke leaf juice contains antihypertensive effect in patients with mild hypertension.\" Phytotherapy Research."

        "0": "But conscientious eaters are looking at the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with all sorts of food production, and scientists are coming up with a few big carbon footprints that might surprise you.\nA recent study published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology looks at the climate impact of various fruits, vegetables, and animal products in the American diet.\nThe scientists assess total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production using a unit that’s a little tricky to parse: kilograms of CO2-equivalent per kilogram of food.\nAt 8.87, it produces six times the amount of GHG than the next-highest vegetable.\n“Air freighting is a lot more carbon-intensive than shipping or road transport,” says Alexander Kasterine, head of the Trade and Environment Programme at the International Trade Centre (a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization).\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, air-freighting takes 50 times the energy of shipping by sea, 33 times that of rail transport, and four times that of truck transport.\nClimate-wise, transport by air is unequivocally worse than other kinds.\nIf you drive a long way to the market in a gas-guzzling vehicle to buy local asparagus, your climate impact could be larger than that of the flown-in variety.\nThose states have a comparative advantage in terms of their climate and their soils.” Those efficiencies, he says, “more than make up for the transport emissions,” which are only about 10 percent of total climate impact as long as shipping isn’t done by air.\nIt’s possible that your air-freighted produce is making a huge difference to a farmer in Asia, Africa, or South America.\nThen there’s the problem of trying to figure out whether any particular produce is air-freighted.\nIf it’s a delicate fruit or vegetable, and it comes from a long way off (produce is required to be labeled with country of origin), it’s a good bet that it’s been on a plane.\nAs Kasterine says, “It’s not evident what the right choices are.” He has a suggestion: “Relying on altruism doesn’t work to de-carbonize the economy.\nTax the energy used to produce the food.”  And not just in the supply chain, he adds, but in your house, when you cook, and in your vehicle, when you drive to the market.",
        "1": "In fact, this area has become one of the main producers of green asparagus worldwide due to the availability of water and the high yield rates that can be reached.\nHowever, irrigation and intensive agriculture constitute a significant threat to water depletion in the region, as well as to important changes in land use.\nThe aim of the study was to understand the potential environmental impacts associated with the cultivation of this product in a hyper-arid area.\nEnvironmental impacts were strongly influenced by the high energy intensity linked to the production of inorganic fertilizers used on-site and, to a lesser extent, plant protection agents.\nFinally, the use of methyl bromide to fumigate green asparagus at US customs implied a high burden in terms of ozone depletion.",

        "1": "This never-ending demand for avocado is fueling avocado prices, which drives more and more farmers to avocado farming for the profit, regardless of its effects on the environment.\nConsequently, Mexican farmers are slowly clearing the pines to make way for this profitable fruit.\nIllegal thinning of pine trees is so rampant in the Michoacán region of Mexico that estimates show a shocking 30 to 40 percent of the forest is lost annually to pave way for avocado farming.\nThe effects of this are obvious – rivers are running dry due to lack of adequate rainfall, wildlife and other organisms that are dependent on the forest are dying and becoming extinct, and drought is now becoming more pronounced than previous years.\nAn avocado plantation requires a substantial amount of water to produce in abundance, twice as much as a regular forest.\nOne report estimates that on average, you need approximately 75 gallons (283 liters) of water to produce about one pound (a half a kilogram) of avocado, which translates to about two to four medium-sized avocados.\nImagine how much water is needed to produce the millions that feed the world.\nUnlike natural forests, avocados require pesticides to survive the pests that consume these fruits.\nAnd to get a high-quality grade avocado fruit that will fetch money, farmers must use tons of pesticides to protect these avocado orchards.\nReports say that the cartel makes close to $150 million each year from ‘avocado tax’ and owns 10 percent of all the avocado farms in that area.\nHowever, the fact remains that avocados are seasonal fruits whose season starts in March and ends in late July in California.\nAlthough this may not apply due to people’s love for avocados in their meals, more is required to limit the side effects of avocado farming.\nFor the sustainability of our planet, we need to find ways to benefit this planet, instead of stripping it off its nutrients and water source without giving something back in return.",
        "2": "The health benefits gained from consuming these healthy fat alternatives is not limited to only anti-obesity results.\nBut like everything else in life, receiving a benefit comes at a cost- and I’m not talking about the $1.95 extra we pay to have guacamole on our tacos.\nI’m talking about the social and environmental costs of America’s increasing obsession of wanting avocado all year round.\nIt’s good to know when avocado season is in our own country because when you buy avocado at any other time you are more than likely buying avocado from another country, which means more greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and less support towards farmers in our own country.\nAs a result of the demand from the US for avocados, farmers in Mexico are influenced to increase the size of their farms, which is now leading to environmental issues including deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn our own country, a drought that started in 2012 and has lasted until a few months ago in California has led to avocado prices rising to an all-time high.\nAccording to several news sources, avocado growers and pickers in Mexico reported being extremely unhappy with the wages they receive, leading them to hold a workers strike and slowing down the supply of avocados into the U.S. Like many agricultural jobs, the workdays are long and hard, income is insufficient, child labor is common, and the job itself is insecure.\nClearly, the dollar amount we pay for avocados might seem high at face value, but knowing more about the health benefits, and the environmental and social costs of eating this fruit, will hopefully help put everything into perspective next time you decide to indulge yourself in this luxurious treat.\nIf you’re looking for good fats to eat during the off season, eggs, walnuts and fish caught in Lake Superior (lake trout, salmon, whitefish), are among some alternatives to avocados that will not only help your health, but will also support local Michigan farmers.\nMichigan State University Extension promotes healthy eating, a variety of sources for nutritional balance, and the Michigan farmers and fishers that provide food in our state.\nGet news about Michigan State University Extension Community Food Systems and Farmers Markets education in your inbox."

        "2": "Avocados, or Persea americana, have a long cultivation history, dating back to about 500 BC These oval- to pear-shaped fruits are native to Central and South America, originally found in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala and the lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\nWhile varieties vary in size and skin color when ripe, they are all equally considered a heart-healthy superfood.\nAvocados are high in healthy monounsaturated fats like oleic acid , which is an omega-9 fatty acid.\nMonounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are heart-healthy fats.\nThey help to reduce inflammation, lower bad cholesterol, increase good cholesterol, and reduce risks for coronary heart disease and other chronic health issues.\nThe monounsaturated fats in avocados can help your body better absorb vitamins like A, D, E, and K.\nAvocados can even help your body get more nutritional value from the other foods you eat ,passing the nutrients into your bloodstream where they're quickly put to use.\nLike all fats, avocados are not a low-calorie food.\nKeep portions to about a  ½ to one whole  medium avocado a day if you are trying to lose or maintain your weight.\nFor example: They can help your heart.\nThese fruits are especially good for your heart health, with fatty acids like oleic acid working to calm inflammation, improve cholesterol, and lower blood triglyceride levels.\nThat helps keep things like depression, sleep disorders, artery blockage, and blood clots at bay.\nThey can help your digestion.\nAvocados have plenty of benefits to your health."

        "1": "Barley is one of the world's oldest grains, dating back more than 1,000 years to Southwest Asia where it was first farmed.\nCultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) is what you are likely to find on store shelves in modern times, but this grain was derived from a wild species (Hordeum spontaneum).\nIn the United States, barley production ranks fourth among cereal grains, behind corn, wheat, and rice.\nBarley is a versatile grain that can be used in salads, soups, or just served as a side dish.\nBarley provides fiber, protein, and micronutrients including selenium and niacin.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a one-cup serving (about 157g) of cooked, pearled barley.1﻿ A one-cup serving of cooked, pearled, barley provides 193 calories, most of which are carbohydrates.\nYou'll consume 44.3 grams of carbohydrates in a single serving, 6 grams of fiber, and 0.4 grams of naturally-occurring sugar.\nOne cup of hulled barley (184g) provides 651 calories, 135 grams of carbohydrate, 31.8 grams of fiber, and 1.48 grams of naturally-occurring sugar, according to USDA data.2 A single cup of raw, hulled barley yields about 3 1/2 of cooked barley.\nOne cup of pearled barley yields 4 cups cooked.\nBarley flour provides about 511 calories per cup (148g) serving.\nThere are 110 grams of carbohydrates, 14.9 grams of fiber, 15.5 grams of protein, and 1.18 grams of sugar in that serving size.3 The University of Sydney reports a glycemic index of 35 for pearled barley that has been boiled for 60 minutes.4 They also include barley with a glycemic index of 27 (making it a low glycemic food), but do not specify how or if it is cooked and whether or not it is pearled.5 There is less than one gram of fat (0.7 grams) in a single one-cup serving of boiled, pearled barley as long as no oil or butter is used in the cooking process.\nBarley contains about 3.6 grams of protein per one-cup cooked serving.\nAs a basis for comparison, brown rice provides about 4.5 grams of protein, quinoa provides about 8 grams per one-cup cooked serving, and Kamut provides 9.8 grams per one-cup serving.\nBarley is an excellent source of selenium, providing 13.5 micrograms or about 24.5% of the daily value (DV) set by the FDA that is used for food labels.\nMany studies conducted about the health effects of barley involve the whole grain (hulled) variety.\nIn a report published by New Zealand’s Heart Foundation, researchers reviewed studies related to whole grain consumption.\nThis effect was seen when whole grains were consumed within the context of an energy-restricted diet or healthy dietary pattern.\nThey also noted that the soluble fiber in oats and barley has a greater beneficial effect on total and LDL cholesterol (3-8% reduction), especially in people with raised lipid levels.6﻿ Barley is rich in dietary fiber, providing 6g per one-cup serving (as long as you choose the whole grain type).\nBarley's fiber content is higher than many other whole grains.\nOrganizations including the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health recommend that we make better efforts to consume the recommended dietary intake of fiber.7 In addition, the 2020-2025 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans has mentioned that fiber has been a nutrient of public health concern since 2005.\nThe current daily value for fiber provided by the FDA is 28 grams per day.8﻿ Fiber can provide health benefits including improved blood glucose, improved blood cholesterol, and even a reduced risk of certain cancers.9﻿ Some cereal grains are known to contain phenolic compounds due to their high antioxidant content.\nFree radicals occur naturally in the body, but we are also exposed to free radicals in the environment from things like air pollution or cigarette smoke.10 According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), oxidative stress is thought to play a role in a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and eye diseases such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.10 The phenolic acid profile and antioxidant capacity of barley (along with wheat, corn, rice, sorghum, rye, oat, and millet) have been shown to provide health-promoting phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins.\nResearchers concluded that the presence of these natural antioxidants can play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.11 The fiber provided by barley can provide certain gastrointestinal benefits.\nA research review published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in 2012 found that increasing dietary fiber intake can increase stool frequency in those who have constipation.\nThat review, however, concluded that increased fiber intake did not improve stool consistency, constipation treatment success, laxative use, or painful defecation.12﻿ But another study conducted in 2018 found that adding fiber to the diet in older adults may be effective in increasing stool frequency and/or decreasing laxative use and reducing the burden of constipation.13﻿ Barley is an excellent source of selenium, a nutrient that is important for reproduction and DNA production.\nSelenium also provides antioxidant benefits.14﻿ Some preliminary research conducted at the University of Nebraska suggests that the short-term increased intake of whole grains, particularly whole grain barley, brown rice, or a mixture of the two, might promote healthy changes in the gut microbiota that coincide with improvements in systemic inflammation.\nThe researchers note that systemic inﬂammation may be at the root of many chronic diseases.15﻿ Barley, like wheat, contains cross-reactive proteins that can trigger allergic reactions (separate from gluten sensitivity).\nIf you are unsure if you might have a wheat or barley allergy, visit your healthcare provider to get personalized advice.17﻿ Those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity cannot consume barely.\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\nIf you consume gluten containing grains and have either condition, you may experience symptoms including (but not limited to) unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, arthritis, or canker sores inside the mouth.18 If you avoid gluten you should also stay away from products made from barley, including malt.\nBecause part of the grain has been removed, pearled barley is not considered a whole grain.\nSome consumers prefer pearl barley because it cooks faster than whole-grain barley.\nIf you prefer a whole grain, look for hulled barley.\nThe grain (sometimes called dehulled barley) has had the tough, inedible, outer hull removed.\nThis removal process keeps the bran in tact so the barley is still considered a whole grain.\nBarley should be stored like you store all of your grains.\nOnce it is cooked, keep barley in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to three days.\nTo cook pearl barley, bring two quarts of water to a boil in a large pot on high heat.\nOnce the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the barley has reached your desired texture.\nTo prepare the grain, place one cup of the barley in a pot with about six cups of water and a dash of salt.\nBarley, pearled, cooked.\nUpdated 12/6/2019 Barley, pearled, boiled 60 min.\nFit More Fiber Into Your Day.

        "2": "Like other whole grains, it’s super-good for you—in fact, epidemiological studies have linked eating barley with the potential to reduce the risk of certain diseases.\nWhen it comes to folate and vitamin E, brown rice wins; but barley takes the trophy for fiber (it has much, much more) and calcium.\n“And fiber has a range of health benefits, from supporting healthy digestion to helping with weight loss by enhancing satiety to promoting better glycemic control,” says Stefani Sassos MS, RDN, the registered dietician with the Good Housekeeping Institute.\nAlong with that fiber, barley also has 3.5 grams of protein—not anywhere close to the amount in other whole grains like quinoa, kamut, or teff, but it’s something.\nBarley has a good amount of several different nutrients that help keep your body humming.\nBarley is a good source of another B vitamin, B6, which helps our brains and our immune systems.\nThere are thousands and thousands of different types, and scientists know less about them than they know about vitamins and minerals — but they have figured out that they may be one of the things in plants that help prevent diseases like heart disease and cancer.\nAnd researchers have found that barley is rich a few different types.\nFlavonoids are the substance in whole grains that's thought to help protect against heart disease, and even cancer.\nMore research is needed on this, but among whole grains, barley is one of the best sources of a phytochemical called tocols, which has been reported to have antioxidant properties, and has been found to potentially reduce the risk of stroke.\nIt’s not certain, but researchers think that barley contains this substance."

        "0": "Over recent years, consumers have become more concerned about the environmental impact of the products they buy, especially food.\nThe zero waste movement would suggest that you should buy dried beans as an alternative to tinned.\nBy buying them in dried form you are reducing the amount of packaging required, therefore reducing the energy required to produce the product, and reducing the waste you generate by buying it.\nIf they’re destined to be sold as dried beans, they’ll then be decanted into smaller bags to be made ready for the shelf.\nIf they’re going to be sold as canned beans, there are a few additional steps before they reach the shelf.\nThese additional steps make it appear that buying dried beans is more environmentally friendly.\nAdd on top of that the energy and resources required to produce the stainless steel cans the beans are then packaged in.\nPlus, these beans are then packaged in water, meaning they are heavier and take up more room than dried beans, so they also require more energy in transportation.\nSo, it’s likely true that when you buy beans on the shelf, dried beans are more environmentally friendly.\nOne study suggested that cooking dried beans at home requires 11 times the amount of energy than it takes at a processing facility.\nUltimately the difference in environmental impact between canned and dried beans is always going to be pretty small.\nWe have no real way of knowing what the difference in environmental impact between a supermarket’s dried beans and canned beans is, because we have no personal knowledge of the process, and there’s a lack of transparency about it from manufacturers, processors, and retailers.",
        "1": "However as developing nations aspire towards the “Western diet”, demand for meat and animal products is rapidly climbing.\nShuttling crops through animals to make protein is highly inefficient: in US beef, just 5% of the original protein survives the journey from animal feed to meat on the plate.\nLivestock production is also one of the greatest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, including 65% of man-made nitrous oxide emissions (which have a global warming potential 296 times greater than CO₂).\nThe burden, therefore, must fall on people in richer nations to reduce their meat consumption and embrace other sources of protein.\nAlthough generally cheaper than meat, these are rich sources of protein and also come with essential micronutrients including iron, zinc, magnesium and folate.\nBesides being rich in goodness, pulses are also low in many undesirables including cholesterol, fat and sodium, which all contribute to heart and blood issues.\nFibre content may also explain the satiating effect of pulses: for example, incorporating lentils into energy-equivalent meals causes greater fullness and leads to a lower calorie consumption later in the day.\nPulses are also highly water-efficient; for each gram of protein, the average global water footprint of pulses is only 34% that of pork and 17% that of beef.\nMeanwhile, the carbon footprint of pulses is less than half that of winter wheat and on average 48 times lower than the equivalent weight of British beef cattle.\nCurrently demand is dominated by India and Pakistan, however poor yields mean the two countries import more than 20% of global pulse production.\nOptimising pulse harvests in both developing and developed nations could thus be an easy way to boost global protein production.\nNevertheless, pulses face traditional barriers in the West, including the need for overnight soaking, unappealing tastes and potential flatulence from a high-fibre diet.",
        "2": "But every time I’m at the grocery store, I feel torn between the canned kidney beans and the dried ones in bags.\nTransporting the canned ones must produce more emissions, since they’re heavier, but how does that compare with the carbon footprint of boiling dried beans for hours on a stovetop?\nUp until the point when you pick them off the shelf, there’s no question: Dried, bagged beans are going to be greener than the canned variety.\nWhether they’re sold in a bag or a can, beans that are meant to be eaten in seed form—such as kidney, black, or pinto beans—are initially processed the same way.\n(The latter requires more energy but is often preferred because it cuts down on time and labor and helps prevent bacterial growth.) Then the beans are blanched for a few minutes before being sealed in cans and then cooked and sterilized in a retort—a machine that’s essentially a big, steam-powered pressure cooker.\n(That’s about as much energy as it takes to drive a car one-quarter of a mile.) Since kidneys and pintos are tougher and take longer to cook—about 75 percent longer than green beans, according to Truitt Brothers, the cannerythat commissioned the study—processing them would require more energy.\nThen there’s the excellent point you raised in your question: Getting those canned beans from the production facility to your local Piggly Wiggly is indeed going to require more fuel.\nBeans, when cooked, get 150 percent heavier because of water absorption.\nIn the green-bean study, for example, getting the cans to the customer accounted for only 8 percent of their overall greenhouse gas emissions.\nBased on some recorded energy figures provided by food researchers at the University of Bristol, cooking five ounces of beans for that long might require 1,400 to 5,600 BTUs on a gas stovetop or 4,100 to 16,500 BTUs on an electric stovetop, though everything from the amount of water to the kind of pot used could alter those numbers.\nThe numbers above assume that the electricity is coming from a coal-fired plant, but as the Lantern has often noted in the past, the fuel mix in your area may be cleaner.) On the high end, that’s a lot more energy than the industrial cookers use—even if we assumed that canning dry beans was twice as energy-intensive as canning green beans, cooking those beans on the stove would take up to 11 times as much energy as at a commercial facility."

Some companies are researching ways to replace the more complex cuts of meat that drive the market.\nThese companies aren’t replacing beef with substitutes; they’re trying to grow it in the lab using stem cells.\nNor is it clear that they would have an overall positive impact, unless we are sure that this meat can be made in a more energy-efficient way than we can raise cattle.\nSome believe that raising cattle on pastures, from birth until slaughter, might sequester carbon in the soil better than having cows finish their growth on feed lots.\n“Grass-feeding cattle without grain is the norm in New Zealand, but almost no one in the United States does it,” Dr. Taber said.\nIt’s also worth pointing out that it would probably take longer to raise cows this way, giving them more time to emit methane.\nAnd feeding seaweed to cows, even in small amounts, can significantly reduce their methane burps.\nOne problem with seaweed is that the component that helps reduce methane emissions is classified as a carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nA larger problem is that we are unprepared to farm the unbelievable amount of seaweed it would take to feed all the cattle the world is raising.\nUntil people are truly ready to reduce consumption of dairy or consumption of higher-end beef cuts, or to commit to raising cattle differently, it seems unlikely that any of the changes with respect to ground beef will make a significant environmental difference in the near future.",

beef with 10% fat content (2Trusted Source): Meat — such as beef — is mainly composed of protein.\nThe protein content of lean, cooked beef is about 26–27% (2Trusted Source).\nAnimal protein is usually of high quality, containing all nine essential amino acids needed for the growth and maintenance of your body (3Trusted Source).\nMeat is one of the most complete dietary sources of protein, its amino acid profile being almost identical to that of your own muscles.\nFor this reason, eating meat — or other sources of animal protein — may be of particular benefit after surgery and for recovering athletes.\nLean meat is generally about 5–10% fat (4Trusted Source).\nBeef contains varying amounts of fat, including CLA, which has been linked to health benefits.\nLike plants, meat contains a number of bioactive substances and antioxidants, which may affect health when consumed in adequate amounts.\nAnimal meat like beef contains a number of bioactive substances, such as creatine, taurine, CLA, and cholesterol.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Beef is a rich source of high-quality protein and various vitamins and minerals.\nLike all types of meat, beef is an excellent source of high-quality protein.\nInadequate protein intake may accelerate age-related muscle wasting, increasing your risk of an adverse condition known as sarcopenia (23Trusted Source).\nThe best dietary sources of protein are animal-derived foods, such as meat, fish, and milk products.\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle, regular consumption of beef — or other sources of high-quality protein — may help preserve muscle mass, reducing your risk of sarcopenia.\nIt’s formed in your body from beta-alanine, a dietary amino acid found in high amounts in fish and meat — including beef.\nSupplementing with high doses of beta-alanine for 4–10 weeks has been shown to lead to a 40–80% increase in carnosine levels in muscles (26Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nIn contrast, following a strict vegetarian diet may lead to lower levels of carnosine in muscles over time (29Trusted Source).\nIn human muscles, high levels of carnosine have been linked to reduced fatigue and improved performance during exercise (26Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nOnly found in animal-derived foods, heme iron is often very low in vegetarian — and especially vegan — diets (35Trusted Source).\nThus, meat not only contains a highly bioavailable form of iron but also improves the absorption of non-heme iron from plant foods — a mechanism that has not been fully explained and is referred to as the “meat factor.” A few studies indicate that meat can increase the absorption of non-heme iron even in meals that contain phytic acid, an inhibitor of iron absorption (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that meat supplements were more effective than iron tablets at maintaining iron status in women during a period of exercise (39Trusted Source).\nRich in high-quality protein, beef may help maintain and grow muscle mass.\nObservational studies on red meat and heart disease provide mixed results.\nFor example, many health-conscious people avoid red meat because it has been claimed to be unhealthy (44Trusted Source).\nThe most popular is the diet-heart hypothesis — the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease by raising cholesterol levels in your blood.\nNot all studies observe a significant link between saturated fat and heart disease (47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source).\nStill, most health authorities advise people to limit their intake of saturated fat — including beef tallow.\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle, it’s unlikely that moderate amounts of unprocessed lean beef have any adverse effects on heart health.\nIt’s unclear whether meat consumption or saturated fats in beef increase your risk of heart disease.\nMany observational studies link high meat consumption to an increased risk of colon cancer — but not all studies find a significant association (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).\nA large number of studies indicate that eating well-done meat — or other dietary sources of heterocyclic amines — may increase your risk of various cancers (64Trusted Source).\nOne of these studies found that women who ate well-done meat regularly had a 4.6-fold increased risk of breast cancer (71Trusted Source).\nTaken together, some evidence suggests that eating high amounts of well-done meat may increase your risk of cancer.\nIncreased cancer risk may also be related to unhealthy lifestyle factors often associated with high meat intake, such as not eating enough fruit, vegetables, and fiber.\nHigh consumption of overcooked meat may increase the risk of several types of cancer.\nBeef has been linked to a few adverse health conditions — other than heart disease and cancer.\nPeople with hemochromatosis should limit their consumption of red meat, such as beef and lamb (78Trusted Source).\nPlus, as a rich source of iron, high beef consumption may contribute to excess iron accumulation — especially in people with hemochromatosis.\nIt’s exceptionally rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals.\nHigh consumption of processed meat and overcooked meat has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.\nThis article explains the difference between grass- and grain-fed… Eating processed meat is linked to increased risk of several diseases, including cancer.",
        "1": "Nutritionist Michael Joseph publishes the Nutrition Advance website in the US which provides independent, evidence-based nutrition and health information backed by peer-reviewed studies as evidence.\nHere he takes a closer look at the health benefits of beef.\nA generation or two ago, our parents and grandparents viewed beef as a nutritious health food.\nWhatever our opinion on red meat might be, there are some important health benefits of eating beef.\nL-carnitine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in meat products.\nIt’s important to clarify that our body can synthesize sufficient amounts of L-carnitine for general needs; this makes it a non-essential amino acid.\nThe body synthesizes L-Carnitine within the liver and the process relies on the amino acids L-lysine and L-methionine (2).\nHowever, research suggests that a higher dietary intake of L-Carnitine may have some positive health impacts.\nA systematic review shows that higher L-carnitine intake in type 2 diabetes patients improves fasting glucose levels and the overall cholesterol profile (5).\nIt’s worth noting that while there are many L-carnitine supplements around, the absorption rate is poor in comparison to beef.\nKey Point: L-carnitine is an amino acid that naturally occurs in beef.\nAs a result, keeping glutathione levels high is important for our overall health.\nOn the positive side, beef also contains a reasonably high source of complete (pre-formed) dietary glutathione.\nKey Point: Keeping our glutathione levels high is critical for good health, and beef is a food that helps us to achieve this.\nBeef is packed with health-promoting amino acids, and it’s one of the single biggest sources of protein in the human diet.\nConsidering this, we should ensure we’re eating a sufficient amount of protein – this is especially essential for elderly people.\nOn this note, beef is one of the best protein-rich foods out there.\nKey Point: Protein is essential for optimal health, and especially so as we age.\nSo, the nutritional value of beef can help fight prevalent global deficiencies in iron, magnesium, and zinc (14, 15, 16).\nKey Point: Beef is rich in several essential minerals—especially iron, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc.\nGlobally it’s even worse, and according to the World Health Organization, 1.62 billion people suffer from iron deficiency anemia (18).\nOne of the best health benefits of beef meat is that it contains a substantial amount of heme iron.\nPerhaps this isn’t a huge surprise when we think about how society seems to shame women who eat meat.\nKey Point: Eat more beef to help prevent iron deficiency anemia.\nAnother advantage of eating beef is that it provides an abundance of carnosine.\nCarnosine (beta-analyl-L-histidine) is an amino acid found throughout the body, and it has several important roles in human health.\nAs beef is one of the highest sources of carnosine (containing about 50% more than poultry), this is another health benefit.\nKey Point: Beef (and red meat in general) is the best dietary source of carnosine.\nIt’s important to realize that insufficient vitamin B12 may also increase the risk of depression and mental health issues (25, 26).\nKey Point: Beef is high in B vitamins which help promote health.\nVitamin B12 is particularly important since it isn’t present in plant-based foods.\nAlthough all beef contains CLA, grass-fed meat offers a significantly higher amount than beef from non-ruminants.\nSpecifically, the average amount of CLA in grass-fed beef is 0.46% of the fat content.\nKey Point: Beef—especially from grass-fed cows—is one of the highest sources of conjugated linoleic acid.\nNot only are all of these amino acids present in beef, but beef is one of the single most significant dietary sources for them.\nIn other words, eating beef gives you a decent amount of dietary creatine, and it helps your body to produce it too.\nKey Point: Beef has two positive impacts on creatine levels.\nWe may hear how beef is so much more expensive than vegetables and other plant-based foods.\n200g of beef will typically provide around 550 calories, but 200g of broccoli only contains 70 calories (11, 37).\nKey Point: Per calorie, beef is a very affordable food – it’s cheaper than vegetables.\nKey Point: Beef requires minimal preparation, and it’s quick and simple to cook.\nBeef contains dozens of health-promoting nutrients that we need in our diet.\nBottom line: there are many health benefits of eating beef.\nI love to eat beef and I will maintain to use this healthy diet Very nice.beef meat good for human body.\nBut is beef meat good for persons over 40years?\nI’m sure it will be back, but I’m going to test out this theory that beef supplied a nutrient to help me get over my tinnitus, even if it’s temporary.\nEat real food, find what works for you.\nI have been red meat deficient for a long time now and last evening I had a steak and the instant health lift was a positive moment for me.\nBeef liver especially is a healthy source of this valuable nutrient.\nThe reason women are more prone to anemia has nothing to do with society’s view of women eating meat vs.\nThanks for telling me that eating beef can help our body build more lean muscle mass.\nThanks a lot  Looking into grass-fed beef I was able to find that omega 3’s are so minimal it is almost not statistically significant to categorize it as such.\nTilbuster Pastoral Co. I am sure that grassfed beef has one of the highest levels of omega 3’s of any food including salmon, we all know the health benefits of this.\nHopefully this wakes up a bunch of people and gets them to eat beef.",
        "2": "Beef is one of the foods with high nutritional value and contain many essential amino acids, fats, minerals, vitamins…In addition to providing human beings with the important and precious nutritional values; beef also brings about many benefits for health that people should know.\nTherefore, in the article today, I would like to show you the best health benefits of beef and nutritional benefits of beef that you should know to make use of this material in your daily meals.\nBeef, especially beef shank, is rich in ammonia acid, higher than any other kinds of food, working well to increase muscle mass; especially, strengthening the body's overall health.\nBeef contains huge amounts of vitamin B6 and protein so that it should be added in the daily diet in a regular basis.\nBeef contains a lot of important and essential minerals which are necessary for building muscle, including protein, potassium – the 2 minerals that are indispensable in the diet of a bodybuilder.\nTherefore, people who want to build lean muscle mass should eat more beef in a regular basis.\nAs I mentioned above, beef is an excellent source of vitamin B6 and protein which should be added into in the daily diet regularly for good.\nProtein supports the metabolism and synthesis of food, contributing to the body recovery after intense activity.\nA 3 – ounce serving of beef provides people with about half the average amount of protein  which an adult needs to consume in their daily meals.\nThe amount of protein you get from beef contains all the amino acids which are needed to repair tissue and build muscles.\nCarnitine is mainly used to support the metabolism of fats and amino acid sequence to keep the body balanced, and the amino acids are good and necessary for creating muscle.\nBeef contains many minerals, such as protein, potassium – the two minerals that are indispensable in the daily diet.\nTherefore, people should add potassium to their daily meals, and one of the best health benefits of beef is that it is an excellent source of potassium.\nAnother benefit of adding lean beef to the daily diet is that it is one of the excellent sources of zinc.\nYou need to take zinc from foods because it helps to build muscle mass, strengthen the immune system and support the health of your brain.\nYou should add beef to your daily meals for a healthy diet once or twice a week to take the necessary amount of iron for your body’s red blood cells, helping to transport the sufficient amount of oxygen to all parts of the body.\nVitamin B12 promotes the metabolism of chain amino acid branches, thus providing the essential amount of energy to the body during intense activity.\nRecent studies indicated that Conjugated Linoleic Acid may play an important role in cancer prevention by inhibiting the growth and development of the tumor, as well as affecting the body’s composition by developing lean muscle mass and reducing body fat."

        "1": "Beets contain high levels of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents that studies show may help reduce the risk of some cancers.\nAlso, high levels of a unique fiber found in beets may be linked to a lower colon cancer risk.\nBeets produce nitric acid, which helps increase blood flow throughout your body, including to your brain.\nMRIs done on older adults showed that after eating a high-nitrate diet that included beet juice, the subjects had more blood flow to the white matter of their frontal lobes.\nFiber helps keep your digestive system running smoothly, and one of the many health benefits of beets is that they are chock full of it.\nDespite all these health benefits of beets, there are also some risks.\nNow that you know all of the beets health benefits, check out the 50 healthiest foods you can buy at the supermarket.\nThe post 9 Health Benefits of Beets (and Risks) You Never Knew About appeared first on The Healthy.",
        "2": "Adding colorful beets to your diet can be a visually appealing way to pack some extra nutrition into your favorite dishes.\nFrom reducing inflammation to improving heart health, beets provide many health benefits.\nThe stark red color of beets comes from compounds called betalains.\nBeets are also rich in nitrates, which reduce inflammation by removing harmful compounds from your bloodstream.\nThis combination of betalains and nitrates makes beets a great choice for people with inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia.\nThe nitrates in beets don't just reduce inflammation, they also improve heart health.\nBeets are also naturally low in cholesterol and fat, which makes them a good option for people concerned about heart disease or stroke.\nStudies have shown that the nitrates in beets help these cellular powerhouses function better.\nBeets are a nutrient-dense root vegetable low in calories, fat, and cholesterol, making them a heart-healthy choice.\nBeets can also be added to smoothies with other fruits and vegetables to help sweeten the taste."

        "1": "Traditionally, plants have needed environments similar to these, which provide enough hours of cold temperatures to produce good fruit set.\nIn states such as California that cannot supply enough “chill hours” to support conventionally grown blueberries, horticulturists have bred newer varieties that adapt to warmer environments, if their other needs are also met.\nNew hybrid crosses of southern highbush and rabbiteye selections have yielded plants with higher tolerances for growing in more temperate environments.\nAs tree roots grow, they deplete water and nutrient reserves in soil from blueberries.\nBlueberry roots have three major requirements of soil: acidic pH, loose substrate and moist, but well-draining sites.\nBlueberries need moist soil that does not become waterlogged.\nSufficient water is not only important during fruit development, but it is also needed to set new current-season buds that flower the following season.\nSince blueberry plants set these new buds during the hottest part of summer, gardeners in Mediterranean climates, which receive little rainfall in summer, must provide supplemental water.",
        "2": "Life cycle impacts of Chilean fresh and U.S. frozen blueberries were compared.\nTherefore, in this study, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of Chilean fresh organic blueberries and frozen organic blueberries produced in two representative states in the U.S. This cradle-to-consumer LCA covered the farming and harvesting, processing, transportation, and storage stages.\nThe farming and harvesting, postharvest processing, and transportation were identified as the environmental impact hotspots.\nWhether consumers should choose the frozen or fresh blueberries was found to be highly sensitive to the length of frozen storage and the type of refrigerant used."

        "1": "This article discusses the health benefits and potential downsides to eating bok choy, and suggests a few ways to incorporate it into your diet.\nSimilar to other leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables, bok choy is full of health-promoting nutrients, including a wide array of vitamins and minerals.\nScientists have studied the cruciferous vegetable family for its potential anticancer benefits.\nOne study found that eating bok choy at least once per week was associated with a significantly lower risk of oral, esophageal, colorectal, breast, and kidney cancers, compared with never or occasionally consuming bok choy (10Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, bok choy is a rich source of the mineral selenium, which may also have anticancer benefits.\nIn one analysis of studies, researchers found that high selenium exposure, indicated by levels in the blood or toenails, was related to a lower risk of cancers of the breast, lungs, esophagus, stomach, and prostate (11Trusted Source).\nAnother analysis of studies concluded that high intake of cruciferous vegetables, like bok choy, was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer (12Trusted Source).\nOne study found that having a low level of selenium in the bloodstream was associated with thyroid conditions, such as hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and enlarged thyroid, also called goiter (13Trusted Source).\nOne study found that taking selenium supplements also helped manage these conditions (14Trusted Source).\nStudies have found that reduced levels of these minerals are associated with collagen reduction and an increased risk of osteoporosis, a disease in which bones soften and become prone to fracture (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nBok choy contains the minerals potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which work to help naturally regulate your blood pressure (17Trusted Source).\nHaving unmanaged high blood pressure can be a risk factor for developing heart disease (18Trusted Source).\nBok choy is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may offer benefits for thyroid function and heart and bone health.\nWhile bok choy offers a number of health benefits, it may also come with downsides for some people when consumed in large amounts.\nThis effect may really only be a concern if you eat an unusually large amount of raw cruciferous vegetables over an extended period.\nHowever, the researchers state that typical serving sizes of bok choy probably do not impair thyroid function (1Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, because bok choy is a rich source of vitamin K, you may not want to consume it in larger amounts if you take blood thinning medication.\nThis is because vitamin K plays a role in blood clotting (24Trusted Source).\nA 1-cup (70-gram) serving of loosely packed, chopped bok choy provides about 27% of your daily vitamin K needs (2Trusted Source).\nOne case study suggests that eating bok choy raw in very large amounts may interfere with thyroid function, but this is probably not a concern with typical serving sizes.\nBok choy is a cruciferous, leafy green vegetable native to China.\nIt offers a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, as well antioxidants and fiber that are good for your health.\nBoy choy is also high in vitamin K, so you may want to eat less or avoid it if you take blood thinning medications.\nHere are 14 of the healthiest leafy green vegetables you… Cruciferous vegetables are low-calorie, and rich in folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and fiber.",
        "2": "This article examines the nutritional values and potential benefits of bok choy.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database, here are the nutritional values per 3.5 oz (100g) serving of bok choy (2).\nAs shown in the nutritional values, bok choy is extremely low in calories and contains minimal amounts of carbohydrates, fat, and protein.\nOn this note, cruciferous vegetables contain sulfur-containing compounds known as glucosinolates (5, 6).\nFurther research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the potential effects of glucosinolates on human health.\nMany leafy greens contain high amounts of oxalic acid, which is otherwise known as oxalate (12, 13).\nIt should be noted that foods containing oxalic acid are often very nutritious, and they are not an issue for most healthy people.\nOn the positive side, bok choy is a leafy green with one of the lowest oxalate contents among all vegetables (17).\nBok choy is a significant dietary source of polyphenols, and it contains various flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids (18, 19, 20).\nPurple bok choy varieties include ‘rubi’ and ‘purple hybrid,’ and they contain high concentrations of anthocyanins (27, 28).\nResearch also shows that purple bok choy contains higher amounts of other polyphenols such as kaempferol and quercetin (33).\nAs shown in the nutritional values section, bok choy is an excellent dietary source of vitamins A and C.\nHowever, none of these compounds are preformed vitamin A (otherwise known as retinol).\nBased on the provitamin A content of bok choy, a 100-gram serving contains 223.5 mcg of retinol activity equivalents (RAE).\nBok choy also contains a significant amount of vitamin C, which is equivalent to 50% of the daily value per 100 grams (2, 3).\nOne potential downside of raw bok choy is that it contains several enzymes collectively known as myrosinase.\nThis nutritious green vegetable offers large amounts of vitamins and minerals for a minimal amount of calories.\nAlthough further research is necessary, bok choy may also offer additional benefits from the polyphenols and glucosinolates that it contains."

Fuel for longer: Whole grains and legumes contain complex carbohydrates[8].\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic[9], complex carbohydrates stimulate serotonin production and if you eliminate them entirely from your diet you can become really cranky.\nDoctor Amy Jamieson-Petonic[10], registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic,recommends eating every three to four hours and including complex carbs each time (to feel energized and happy).\n4. Folic acid boost: Fortification is a safe practice where essential vitamins and minerals are added to staple foods such as bread and wheat flour.\nParticularly, in the United States mandatory folic acid fortification of cereal grain products such as refined wheat flour has been established to reduce a woman´s risk of having a baby affected by Spina bifida or other neural tube birth defects.[11]It is estimated that this measure has saved more than 1,300 from neural tube birth defects on a yearly basis.[12] 5.\nFight cancer: The American Institute for Cancer Research[13]includes whole wheat bread and whole grains within the AICR´s Foods that Fight Cancer[14]list published on their site.\nAfter years of study they´ve found that dietary fiber and phytochemicals in whole grains hold anti-cancer properties.",
        "1": "White bread is fortified with calcium and four medium slices per day would provide over 30% of the recommended daily intake of calcium which we need every day to maintain healthy bones and teeth.\nBread, especially wholemeal, is an important source of dietary fibre which helps to keep our digestive system healthy, helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels and makes us feel fuller for longer.\nAn average medium slice of white bread contains 77 calories, brown contains 72 calories and wholemeal contains 79 calories.\nAn average medium slice of white bread contains 0.6g of fat, brown bread contains 0.7g and wholemeal contains 0.9g.\nMost breads are low in sugar which is important for healthy teeth and maintaining a healthy weight.",
        "2": "Recent research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found people who ate 70g (about four servings) of whole grains per day, compared with those who ate little or no whole grains, had a 22% lower risk of premature death, a 23% lower risk of death from heart disease, and a 20% lower risk of death from cancer.\nOne-hundred percent whole grain and whole wheat bread varieties are typically regarded as the best, but other types have their benefits, too.\nIf you are grain-sensitive or have celiac disease, we’ve got you covered with gluten-free options as well.\nEzekiel bread stands out among most varieties because it’s made without added sugar and from sprouted whole grains.\nThe sprouting process increases the amount and bio-availability of vitamins, like vitamin C, and minerals, like folate and lysine, so Ezekiel bread is a bonafide nutritional powerhouse.\nThe sprouted grain can be stored until it’s cooked or milled into sprouted grain flour, and then make bread.\nWet sprouting process: You can also mash wet, sprouted grains into a thick paste to make breads, tortillas, and more; these products are often described as “flourless.” Ezekiel bread is an amazing choice for vegetarians, because it’s made from wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt.\nWhat’s more, sprouted grains are more easily tolerated by people with grain protein sensitivities, may help fight diabetes, protect against fatty liver disease, and reduce your risk for cardiovascular issues.\nWe like Food for Life Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Bread.\nResearch shows flax seed and flaxbread can reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes to boot.\nWe like Alvarado St. Bakery Essential Flaxseed Bread, made from sprouted organic whole flax seeds and wheat berries.\nRye bread is made with rye flour, which comes from a wheat-like plant.\nIt’s thanks to their high source of cholesterol-lowering fiber called beta-glucan, which has also been shown to reduce certain cancers, like colon cancer, diabetes, digestive problems, and heart disease.\nSince 1941, the U.S. has required manufacturers to enrich wheat flour with vitamins B1, B2, B3, and iron because processing takes about 60% of the nutrients out, according to The University of Chicago Press.\nBut even then, the same value of B vitamins and iron that’s taken out isn’t put back in, which is why you want to choose 100% whole wheat bread."

        "2": "Another broccoli, broccoli rabe, does not produce a head and is used as a greens crop.\nThis publication will cover the production and marketing of sprouting broccoli.\nUnlike cauliflower, broccoli is a fairly new crop to American consumers.\nBroccoli was first grown commercially in California, and the first ice-packed crop was shipped east in 1924.\nHowever, broccoli did not become a crop of any significance in the United States until after World War II.\nThe United States is the world's largest producer of broccoli.\nMost of the broccoli harvested in the United States is sold as fresh produce.\nIn 2011, the United States produced more than 2 billion pounds of broccoli with a value of over $750 million on more than 130,000 acres.\nLeading broccoli-producing states are California (90 percent of the crop), Arizona, Texas, and Oregon.\nIn recent years, the northeastern United States produced more than 500 acres.\nBroccoli produced in the northeastern United States is usually available from June through October.\nSeveral marketing alternatives are available to the broccoli grower: wholesale marketing, produce auctions, cooperatives, local retailers, and roadside stands.\nProduction of less than one acre of many vegetable crops is typical for most growers.\nIn wholesale marketing, producers often contract with shippers to market and ship the broccoli for a predetermined price.\nIf you do not use a contractor and choose to ship your broccoli to a wholesale market yourself, your product will be subject to the greatest price fluctuations.\nMarketing cooperatives generally use a pooled cost and price, which spreads price fluctuations over all participating producers.\nLocal retailers are another possible market, but you must take the time to contact produce managers and provide good-quality broccoli when stores require it.\nFor more information on marketing, consult  Fruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Part-time Growers .\nIf you grow broccoli on sandy soil, irrigation is important for optimum plant growth and proper main head and side shoot development.\nBecause broccoli is a cool-season crop, it generally is planted in the spring.\nBroccoli heads must be closed and tight (no yellow petals showing) to be considered good quality.\nWhile broccoli generally is transplanted in the spring, it can be sown directly from seed in late summer or early fall, when soil temperatures are in the high 60s and ambient air temperatures are in the 80s.\nSpacing decisions depend on the row spacing of your equipment, your ability to irrigate, the planting date, and your specific market requirements (small or large heads).\nInsects are a major potential problem in broccoli production.\nSeveral broccoli diseases can cause crop losses.\nMany of the pesticides required for broccoli production are restricted-use pesticides and require a pesticide applicator license to purchase.\nWhen using any pesticides in your enterprise, remember to follow all label recommendations regarding application rates and personal protection equipment (PPE) requirements.\nTo ensure marketing a high-quality product, you should check the broccoli heads for worms, which tend to hide underneath the florets.\nIn the normal course of operations, farmers handle pesticides and other chemicals, may have manure to collect and spread, and use equipment to prepare fields and harvest crops.\nContact your soil and water conservation district, extension office, zoning board, state departments of agriculture and environmental protection, and local governing authorities to determine what regulations may pertain to your operation.\nAlso, several major food distribution chains are beginning to require GAP- and GHP-certified products from their producers.\nYou will need to have any water supply used by your workers or for crop irrigation and pesticide application checked at least twice each year.\nFor more information about GAP and GHP programs, contact your local extension office or your state's department of agriculture.\nSecond, check to see if there are multi-peril crop insurance programs available for your crop or livestock enterprises.\nThere are crop insurance programs designed to help farmers manage both yield risk and revenue shortfalls.\nIf individual coverage is not available for what you grow, you may be able to use the AGR/AGR-Lite program to insure the revenue of your entire farm operation.\nFor more information concerning crop insurance, contact a crop insurance agent or check the Penn State Extension website.\nFinally, the USDA Farm Service Agency has a program called the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP), which is designed to provide a minimal level of yield risk protection for producers of commercial agricultural products that don't have multi-peril crop insurance coverage.\nNAP coverage is available through your local USDA Farm Service Agency office.\nMore information on the use of crop budgets can be found in Enterprise Budget Analysis.\nThis publication was developed by the Small-scale and Part-time Farming Project at Penn State with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Extension Service."

        "1": "Brown rice's health benefits are partially due to the way it is prepared, according to the George Mateljan Foundation for the World’s Healthiest Foods, which promotes the benefits of healthy eating.\nBrown rice is a whole grain, meaning that it contains three parts of the grain kernel: the outer, fiber-filled layer called the bran, the nutrient-rich core called the germ, and the starchy middle layer called the endosperm, according to the Harvard T.\nWhite rice, in contrast, is a refined grain, meaning that the bran and the germ have been removed, leaving just the endospore, HSPH says.\nSome of these nutrients —including B vitamins and iron — are added back to \"enriched\" white rice, but fiber is not added back, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).\nHere are the nutrition facts for brown rice, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates food labeling through the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act: The health benefits of brown rice are largely due to it being a whole grain.\nAccording to HSPH, the fiber in brown rice helps lower cholesterol, moves waste through the digestive tract, promotes fullness, and may help prevent the formation of blood clots.\nBrown rice is considered a low \"glycemic index\" food.\nLow-GI foods have a rating of 55 or less; the average GI for brown rice is 55.\nAs a part of an overall healthy diet, whole grains may help improve cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, according to the AHA.\nIn 2012, Consumer Reports published an article stating that while arsenic is naturally present in a variety of foods, it is more likely to contaminate brown rice because brown rice absorbs a great deal of water while growing.\nHowever, the Food and Drug Administration analyzed over 1,000 rice samples, and in 2014 stated, \"the arsenic levels that FDA found in the samples it evaluated were too low to cause any immediate or short-term adverse health effects.\" The FDA advised maintaining a diet that includes a variety of whole grains.\nBrown rice, like all grains, should be rinsed thoroughly under running water, and any dirt or debris should be removed.\nTo cook brown rice, add one part rice to two parts boiling water or broth.\nBrown rice takes longer to cook than white rice because the fibrous bran layer and nutrient-rich germ layer have been removed, HSPH says.",
        "2": "In moderation, brown rice can be a very nutritious gluten-free carbohydrate and healthy rice choice overall.\nBrown rice nutrition doesn’t have too many calories per serving, but the nutrient content certainly is up there, whether we’re talking brown rice eaten on its own or brown rice protein powder.\nRice nutrition is actually an important topic since about half of the world’s inhabitants (especially East and Southeast Asia) is completely reliant on rice as a staple food in their daily diets.\nRefined carbohydrates like white rice are basically fake foods and do nothing to promote the health of your body.\nBrown rice nutrition, on the other hand, is loaded with vitamins and minerals as well as fiber and protein to balance the carbs in brown rice.\nScientific studies has even shown that brown rice nutrition can reduce the risk of developing diabetes as well as heart problems.\nIt’s also a safe choice for anyone following a gluten-free diet.\nStudies also demonstrate that getting your magnesium from your diet rather than supplements is likely preferable, especially for people who have already suffered heart attacks in the past.\nOne of the most impressive attributes of brown rice nutrition is its extremely high manganese content per serving.\nManganese isn’t talked about as much as some other nutrients, but it’s extremely important to optimal health.\nIt’s an important trace mineral needed for many vital functions, including nutrient absorption, production of digestive enzymes, bone development, formation of blood-clotting factors and immune system defenses.\n(6) Whole grain foods like brown rice contain both fiber and bran.\nThis is why brown rice offers so many more health benefits than white rice — it still has its bran content.\nStudies have shown that the rice bran and fiber contained in brown rice may be able to lower unhealthy cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol.\n(7) Scientific research has shown that opting for brown rice instead of white rice may actually decrease your risk of developing diabetes.\nA 2010 study out of Harvard School of Public Health revealed that if you consume a little over two servings of white rice (about 12 ounces) per week, making the switch to brown rice could decrease type 2 diabetes risk by an estimated 16 percent.\n(8) This isn’t to say that white rice causes diabetes, but brown rice definitely appears to lower the risk of developing diabetes, thus making it a better choice for anyone following a diabetic diet plan.\nSimilar to oatmeal, brown rice is a naturally gluten-free food as long as it’s not contaminated by gluten-containing substances.\n(9) Many people who avoid gluten in their diets can easily fall short on fiber and the beneficial B vitamins found in whole grains.\nBrown rice nutrition facts are quite impressive and definitely beat white rice nutrition any day.\nWhen brown rice is further processed to remove the bran as well, then it becomes white rice and loses most of its nutrients as a result of this processing.\nHighlights of brown rice nutrition include high amounts of manganese, selenium, magnesium, phosphorus and B vitamins.\nA half cup of cooked brown rice only contains a little over 100 calories, and brown rice nutrition is plentiful.\n(12) Unless white rice is enriched, it really doesn’t offer the consumer much of anything in terms of nutrients so white rice nutrition is basically nonexistent.\nHowever, the less popular black rice aka “forbidden rice” is actually even more impressive than brown rice nutrition, but it does contain a lot more calories for the same serving.\nThese whole grain rices are naturally high in B vitamins and other nutrients.\nWhite rice, however, has to have B vitamins added into it in order to provide any white rice nutrition.\nSince brown rice still has the healthy natural oils of the germ, it also has a shorter shelf life compared to white rice.\nI also highly recommend soaking and sprouting your brown rice before cooking it, which has been found to decreases allergens and phytic acid content while increasing the absorption of nutrients.\nBrown rice generally needs more cooking time than white rice.\n(Kind of how you would cook pasta — six to 10 parts water per one part rice.) Scientists proved this method could reduce arsenic levels, especially inorganic arsenic, in rice by up to 40 percent.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and healthy recipes in the world...Sign up to get VIP access to his eBooks and valuable weekly health tips for FREE!"

CRÊTE, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 Cabbage, Brassica oleracea subsp.\nCabbage is cooked as a green vegetable, eaten raw, and frequently preserved as in sauerkraut or pickle.\nJaiswal, in Nutritional Composition and Antioxidant Properties of Fruits and Vegetables, 2020 Cabbage, also referred to as Brassica oleracea L.\ncapitata, is a cruciferous Brassica vegetable hailing from the Cruciferae plant family or mustard family.\nAside from cabbage, the Brassica genus is comprised of various other leafy vegetable cultivars including broccoli, Brussel sprouts, garden cress, cauliflower, collard greens, mustard, turnips, and bok choy to name a few.\nThe main varieties of cabbage cultivars include red, white, and savoy cabbages which can be prepared in a number of ways for eating, that is, stewed, shredded, steamed, pickled, fermented, boiled, sautéed, or eaten raw.\nIt is estimated that cabbage comprises approximately 30% of the total production of ground vegetables in Poland and in Sweden the average person consumes 6.3 kg of cabbage annually with a coleslaw-like dish being a major source of cabbage intake (Wennberg et al., 2006).\nApproximately 88% of the world’s cabbage consumption is while it is in its fresh form, whilst in countries such as Germany and Austria, fermented cabbage (sauerkraut) is more popular, with Canada, the United States, and Russia also being large consumers of sauerkraut (Chun et al., 2004; Kusznierewicz et al., 2008).\nLong before being used as a food source, traditionally cabbage was used for medicinal purposes for treating various types of cancer, headaches, diarrhea, gout, peptic ulcers, as well as for detoxifying the body (Higdon et al., 2007; Šamec et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2006).\nFrom the available scientific literature, it has been reported that the health benefits of cabbage are linked to the beneficial compounds referred to as “phytochemicals” contained within this vegetable.\nPhytochemicals are naturally occurring biologically active compounds in plants which are released as a means of protection in response to environmental stresses or pathogens but are also said to provide several health benefits when consumed (Martinez et al., 2017).\nCabbage is considered an excellent source of polyphenols with substantial antioxidant properties associated with the alleviation of oxidative stress and the prevention of free-radical mediated diseases.\nBlanching causes adverse losses in the antioxidant capacity of cabbage with over 70% resulting within the first few minutes.\nBlanching time, water to cabbage ratio, and cabbage variety are the main determinants of the extent of antioxidant losses.\nHigh temperatures and short blanching times would reduce antioxidants degradation in cabbage while also resulting in optimized sensory and quality attributes.\nLuud J.W.J. Gilissen, in Nutritional and Health Aspects of Food in Western Europe, 2020 Cabbage in various forms are considered cultivar groups of a single species (Brassica oleracea), originated from the wild cabbage (B.\nThe West-Friesland area, i.e., the north-west part of the Netherlands, where the major Dutch (read international) vegetable seed companies are located, was and still is extremely suitable for the cultivation of high quality vegetables, including cabbage.\nThe typical flavor of cabbage is caused by a metabolite type, called glucosinolates (sulfur containing glucosides), which may stimulate the production of detoxifying enzymes in the body.\nCabbage (and cruciferous vegetables in general) may reduce the risk of colon cancer.\nFang, in Nuts and Seeds in Health and Disease Prevention, 2011  Glucosinolate, sulfur-containing organic anions bonded to glucose, is present in plants, including cabbages.\nOne such product, thiocyanate, exerts harmful effects on the thyroidal metabolism owing to competition with iodine.\nWhether the average daily intake of thiocyanate through Brassicaceae vegetables in Korea has any effect on health remains to be seen (Han & Kwon, 2009).\nThis can be avoided by blanching the entire or chopped cabbage for 5 minutes, replacing the water with fresh water, and then cooking the cabbage.\nToxic amounts of S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide, an alpha-amino acid that can induce hemolytic anemia in livestock, are produced by all Brassica vegetables.\noleracea) is the only vegetable in which vitamin B12 is found, which is recognized for its well-functioning nervous system.\nCabbage juice is considered as one of the most effective remedies for healing vitamin C deficiency.\nBeverages obtained from cabbage juice have a high content of vitamins, calcium, magnesium, iodine, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and copper, and have strong anticancer effects.\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of raw cabbage and sauerkraut juices of different origins (industrial or organic farming) and their major indole components (I3C—indole-3-carbinol and DIM—diindolylmethane) on aromatase expression in two breast cancer cell lines.\nThe results suggest that chemopreventive activity of cabbage against breast cancer may be partly explained by inhibition of the aromatase expression (Licznerska et al., 2013, 2016).\nYau-Sang Chan, in Nuts and Seeds in Health and Disease Prevention, 2011  Glucosinolate, sulfur-containing organic anions bonded to glucose, exists in plants including cabbages.\nOne such decomposed product, thiocyanate, exerts harmful effects on thyroidal metabolism, owing to competition with iodine.\nWhen this was compared to published animal studies, average thiocyanate intake per person was lower than doses required to produce adverse effects.\nYusuf Tutar, in Nutrients in Beverages, 2019 Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a cold-tolerant vegetable grown in winter that belongs to the Cruciferae family.\nBecause of its rich phytochemical content, cabbage juice may show antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticarcinogenic effects.\nThe antioxidant activity of cabbage is related with the high vitamin C content (Dumbravă et al., 2011).\nThe antiinflammatory effects of the acetone extract of cabbage were investigated.\nThe rats were divided into five groups and given SSJ at three different doses for 28 days and the effects of high-fat diet on obesogenic properties were determined.\nIn another study, rats were fed cabbage juice in order to compare its effect on peptic ulcer with medical treatment.\nAfter 30 days, cabbage juice exerted shorter bleeding and clotting times when compared with drugs and this effect was related to vitamin K content (Oguwike et al., 2014).\nIf these rings form, the eggs were probably cooked too long and at temperatures that were too high.\nTo help prevent sulfur rings, eggs should be placed into cold water and then quickly brought to a boil over high heat.\nCabbage and its relatives in the cruciferous family (broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts) do not lose all of their sulfur compounds after cutting or cooking.\nAdditionally, more sulfur-containing molecules may be formed when cruciferous vegetables are cooked."

Wagner, in Developments in Plant Genetics and Breeding, 2000 Practically all cultivated forms of cantaloupe belong to the highly polymorphic species Cucumis melo L.\nThe gene encoding SAMase has been introduced into the Cucumis melo genome using standard Agrobacterium binary vectors.\nWhen expressed, SAMase alters the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and causes a modified fruit ripening phenotype in cantaloupe.\nNon-transformed cantaloupe lines A and B are proprietary inbred lines developed by Harris Moran Seed Company, Inc, San Juan Bautista, California, USA.\nTransgenic line A was obtained through transformation of the parental inbred line A with a binary vector carrying the SAMase gene.\nSimilarly, transgenic line B is derived from a homozygous R1 progeny selected from an original R0 transformant B that was obtained by transformation of the parental inbred line B.\nThere are many examples of fruit-specific and ripening-associated promoters from plants.\nFor the expression of SAMase in cantaloupe, a novel ethylene responsive hybrid promoter was synthesized from elements of the tomato E8 and E4 promoters (Deikman et al., 1992; 1998; Xu et al., 1996; Clendennen et al., in press).\nThe resulting binary expression vector was used in the transformation of the A and B parental lines, independently.\nStable integration of the sam-k transgene into the cantaloupe genome results in the production of a functional SAMase protein.\nThe E8::E4:sam-k translational fusion present in lines A and B expresses SAMase in a fruit-specific and ethylene responsive manner, as determined by western blot analysis of total protein from different tissues of field-grown cantaloupe.\nTransgenic lines A and B initiate expression of the SAMase protein at varying levels in fruits that has begun to mature (full slip) and continue to express in fully mature (post slip) fruits.\nData collected from these trials, as well as from laboratory analyses demonstrate that SAMase-expressing cantaloupe lines A and B, except for the intended impact of SAMase expression on ethylene biosynthesis and related processes, do not differ from the non-transgenic parental varieties.\nSAMase melons show significant reductions (up to 60 %) in ethylene biosynthesis, both as inbreds homozygous for the introduced SAMase transgene and as hybrids generated with non-transgenic lines.\nSAMase melons also show minimal delay in the time from pollination to maturity, and initial results indicate that the fruit of the transgenic plants may be characterized as ripening more uniformly in the field.\nOther horticultural traits and yield are minimally impacted by SAMase expression, with the transgenic fruit most often showing no statistical differences from the non-transformed controls.\nIt was frequently observed that the concentration of soluble sugars was significantly higher in the transgenic fruit compared with the controls.\nchrysogenum NRRL 1951 from

mutants currently used for the industrial production of penicillin, which reaches titers of more than 50 g l−1 in fed-batch cultures.\nThe amplification of the genomic region that includes the three penicillin biosynthetic genes, pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE, is one of the well-characterized modifications.\nThese genes are arranged in a single cluster located in a DNA region present as a single copy in the genome of the wild-type NRRL 1951 and Wisconsin 54-1255 strains (laboratory reference strain), but that is amplified in tandem repeats in penicillin-overproducing strains [16].\nIn addition to these genetic modifications, microbodies (peroxisomes) are also known to be more abundant in high-producing strains [17].\nThese organelles are involved in the final steps of the penicillin pathway, since activation of the side-chain precursor and its addition to the penam core take place in the peroxisomal matrix.\nTranscription of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acid precursors for penicillin biosynthesis, as well as of genes encoding microbody proteins, was higher in high-producing strains [17].\nIn addition, the increase in penicillin production along the industrial strain improvement program seemed to be also a consequence of complex metabolic reorganizations, pointing to oxidative stress responses as adaptation mechanisms for penicillin overproduction [24] (see Chapters.\nAs has been indicated so far, the rounds of classical mutagenesis introduced random modifications that led to the development of penicillin-overproducing strains.\nchrysogenum strains in

~70 µmol/L and with greater intakes circulating concentrations of vitamin C will reach, or exceed, the renal threshold of 80 µmol/L and result in increasing urinary excretion [47].\nIn the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), about 10% of the included American population suffered from severe vitamin C deficiency (plasma concentration less than 11 µmol/L) [47].\nAdditionally, 20% of males and 15% of females had marginal vitamin C deficiency (determined as plasma concentrations between 11 and 28 µmol/L) [49].\nThe UK National Dietary Nutrition Survey showed that the mean plasma vitamin C concentration for men aged 19 to 64 years was 49.9 μmol/L and for women aged 19 to 64 years 55.2 μmol/L and both were above the level indicative of biochemical depletion.\nPrevalence of vitamin C deficiency (<11 µmol/L) was approximately 10% in men and women aged 65 to 74 years but increased progressively with age (~16% in people 75 to 84 years and ~19% in those 85 years and over) and approached 40% in older people living in care homes.\nThe Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey (2003–2005) of a representative sample of the low-income/materially deprived UK population estimated that 25% of men and 16% of women had deficient plasma vitamin C concentrations.\nThe authors concluded that the elderly would require double the oral intake of vitamin C, as compared with younger subjects, to maintain plasma concentration of 50 µmol/L [51,52].\nChuck Palmer was one of 147 individuals across 28 states who experienced listeriosis as a result of eating

(1Trusted Source): Cashews are especially rich in unsaturated fats — a category of fats linked to a lower risk of premature death and heart disease (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nCashews are low in sugar and rich in fiber, heart-healthy fats, and plant protein.\nNuts and seeds are considered antioxidant powerhouses, and cashews are no exception (11Trusted Source).\nIn turn, this helps reduce inflammation and increases your body’s ability to stay healthy and free from disease (12Trusted Source).\nCashews are a rich source of polyphenols and carotenoids — two classes of antioxidants also found in other tree nuts (13Trusted Source).\nStudies link antioxidants in nuts like walnuts, pecans, and almonds to lower levels of oxidative cell damage (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nThis may be particularly true of roasted cashews, which appear to have an increased antioxidant activity compared with their raw counterparts (17Trusted Source).\nThat said, the number of cashew-specific studies are limited and more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (17Trusted Source).\nCashews are rich in carotenoids and polyphenols, two categories of antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and offer protection from disease.\nHowever, research is starting to link nut-rich diets to greater weight loss and overall lower body weights than nut-free diets (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, roasting or grinding nuts may increase your body’s ability to fully digest them, thereby increasing the number of calories absorbed (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nAs a result, weight loss benefits may be strongest for whole, raw cashews, although more research is needed to confirm this.\nIn addition to providing fewer calories than expected, nuts are also rich in protein and fiber, which are known to reduce hunger and promote feelings of fullness, both of which can further promote weight loss (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nDiets rich in nuts, including cashews, have been consistently linked to a lower risk of disease, such as stroke and heart disease (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nOne found that people with type 2 diabetes who consumed 10% of their daily calories from cashews had lower LDL (bad) cholesterol to HDL (good) cholesterol ratios than those who ate no cashews at all (28Trusted Source).\nA low LDL to HDL ratio is typically viewed as a marker of good heart health (29Trusted Source).\nTwo other studies link cashew nut consumption to higher HDL cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure, as well as lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nThey conclude that although cashews are just as likely to benefit heart health as other nuts, more research is needed to confirm this.\nNut-rich diets are consistently shown to be beneficial to heart health.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes may benefit from adding cashews to their diet.\nThat’s in part because cashews are a good source of fiber, a nutrient that helps prevent blood sugar spikes and which is believed to offer protection against type 2 diabetes (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHowever, in one study, people with type 2 diabetes who ate 10% of their daily calories from cashews had overall lower insulin levels — a marker of blood sugar control — than those who ate no cashews at all (28Trusted Source).\nSubstituting foods higher in net carbs and sugar with cashews is likely to help reduce blood sugar levels (11Trusted Source).\nThat said, more research is needed to examine the effects of cashew-rich diets in people with type 2 diabetes.\nCashews are low in sugar and rich in fiber — two factors which, when combined, may help reduce blood sugar levels and protect against the development of type 2 diabetes.\nIf your goal is to limit excess salt or added fats, consider choosing dry roasted or raw unsalted cashew varieties whenever possible (36Trusted Source).\nChoose dry roasted or raw unsalted varieties whenever possible.\nSome research suggests that roasted cashews may contain higher levels of health-promoting antioxidants than raw cashews.\nConsider roasting raw cashews yourself at home without extra oils (17Trusted Source).\nSoaking your nuts overnight before adding them to dishes will help reduce their phytate content and improve their digestibility (37Trusted Source).\nFor most benefits, consider purchasing raw, unsalted cashews and soaking them before eating, whenever possible.\nSimilarly to nuts, cashews may promote weight loss, blood sugar control, and heart health.\nJust remember to pick unsalted dry roasted or raw varieties whenever possible.\nThis article explores whether cashews are truly nuts… You may be at increased risk for a cashew allergy if you're allergic to another tree nut.\nThey have various impressive health benefits and can even help you lose weight."

        "1": "(The Lantern is with Liz Lemon and G.K Chesterton on this point.) But there’s no doubt that cheese of any type—pasteurized or not; made from the milk of cows or goats or sheep—has a significant impact on the environment compared with other food products.\nBased on figures from Sweden, the production of a 1.5-ounce serving of cheese might be expected to produce around 16 ounces of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nAs we’ve discussed before, raising a milk-bearing animal puts out a significant amount of greenhouse gases, thanks in large part to the methane those ruminants emit.\nThe good news is that the American dairy industry hopes to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent in the next 10 years, through strategies like adjusting cows’ diets and installing methane digesters to turn manure into electricity.\nGenerally speaking, sheep cheese is going to be worse for the planet than cow or goat varieties.\nResearchers from MTT Agrifood Research Finland, writing for the newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat in 2008, estimated that greenhouse gas emissions per unit of cheese would be roughly the same for cows and goats.\n(Cattle emit much more methane but make up for it with their increased milk yields.) A sheep, however, might emit twice the amount of methane as a cow or a goat, per unit of milk produced.\nAn exact comparison would require more information about the husbandry practices being used in each case, though—and studies from New Zealand indicate that some sheep are less gassy than others.\nAll things being equal, younger cheeses are more energy-efficient than older ones, because of the electricity required to keep cheeses at a cool, steady temperature as they age.\nIn Europe, they make greater use of cool underground caves.) Likewise, soft cheeses will tend to be greener than hard ones, since the latter usually require more milk, more extensive aging processes, and longer cooking at higher temperatures.\nA recent study noted that Americans toss out a shocking 40 percent of the food we produce—a figure worth keeping in mind during this festive season of gluttony.",
        "2": "LCA results were determined by milk production impact (cow feeding).\nResults indicated that the environmental impacts derived from cheese making were mainly originated from raw milk production and the natural land transformation was the most affected of the considered categories.\nAdditionally, an average carbon footprint of the cheeses produced in the analysed facility has also been calculated, resulting milk production and pellet boiler emissions the most contributing subsystems.\nAccording to the analysed data, it is clear that the content of fat and dry extract are determinant factors for the carbon footprint of cheeses, whereas the cheesemaking scale and the geographical area have a very low effect."

        "1": "Michael Yaziji, Professor of Strategy and Organisation at IMD, suggests that to solve the current environmental issues we need to turn negative outputs into positive inputs.\nThe notion of sustainability-as-less: fewer people, fewer resources, less production, less consumption and less pollution is actually not enough.\nWe absolutely need to do all of these things if we are going to give our children anything like the planet that we inherited, but it needs to be complemented by another approach that leverages the growth imperative that got us in this mess in the first place.\nGiven this, environmental damage can be limited by reducing population, getting poorer and improving technology.\nTherefore firms are not likely to do enough in terms of reduction to turn things around.\nThis would look like cement that has a negative CO2 footprint; or waste product pollution being turned into housing materials.\nThis could also play out in the form of an industrial system that has no waste, or even better, that takes wastes or pollutions from outside the system and converts them into products and services as well as environmental benefits.\nCradle to Cradle, a popular book by William McDonough & Michael Braungart, provides a cherry tree as a beautiful model for us to replicate.\nA cherry tree in full bloom is stunning in its abundant beauty of hundreds of thousands of blossoms.\nTomorrow’s sustainability is called industrial ecology and holds out the promise for a rich, prosperous, and flourishing society that has no waste.\nWe have very few examples of completely sustainable industrial ecologies, but in my strategy work with companies I see more and more companies stumbling into it as they look for new businesses and new business models.\nFor example, the number of firms that are looking into waste-streams as critical inputs is stunning; I’d predict that the waste industry will look nothing like it does today.\nOne smart firm I work with takes waste from municipalities (and gets paid for it), using some of it as in input for construction materials (which they get paid for), and sells the rest to incinerators for fuel (netting yet a third revenue stream).\nThe imperatives that drive firms’ decisions are profit based, but as their standard raw resource inputs become more expensive and less available as there are growing waste streams from other industries, and as regulations are increasingly stringent around raw resource usage and pollution, the opportunities multiply.\nFirms need to be creative, explore profitable business models with waste streams as inputs, leading to overall positive (not just less negative) environmental impacts.\nThey need to think about getting into these new business models and market spaces more and more, rather than focusing on just the old school notion of less and less.\nWe need to limit or reverse population growth as much as possible, but recognize that it isn’t likely to be enough.\nThis is the thinking behind so many companies’ sustainability reports that brag about a 10% reduction of this input resource or a 15% reduction of that pollutant.",

        "1": "Cherries are not only one of the healthiest fruits, they also rank as one of the most health protective foods overall.\nBut here are seven more reasons why this stone fruit is a nutritional all-star, and easy ways to eat more cherries year-round.\nThe anti-inflammatory effect of cherries helps keep your body healthy; but what's more, cherries rank lower than many fruits on the glycemic index.\nTart cherries in particular are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a hormone that helps control your sleep-wake cycles.\nOne study in men and women with insomnia found that compared to a placebo, eight ounces of tart cherry juice in the morning and again one to two hours before bed increased sleep time by an hour and 24 minutes.\nRegularly incorporating cherries or 100% cherry juice into your meal or snack routine may help lessen your joint pain.\nIn one study, gout patients who consumed cherries for just two days (both the fresh fruit, as well as cherry extract and juice) showed a 35% lower risk of gout attacks compared to those who did not eat cherries.\nResearch has shown that drinking tart cherry juice can help lower total cholesterol, including the “bad” type, known as LDL.\nLook for frozen cherries, freeze-dried powders, 100% tart cherry juice, and preservative-free dried cherries.\nAdd tart cherry juice to sparkling water.",
        "2": "The nutrients and bioactive components in cherries support their preventive health benefits.\nA 2018 review of the health benefits of cherries published in the journal Nutrients summarized the results of 29 published human studies that examined the positive effects of cherry consumption.\nResearchers found that eating cherries and products made with cherries decreased oxidative stress, inflammation, exercise-induced muscle soreness and loss of strength, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, arthritis symptoms, and loss of sleep.\n(1) The benefits of cherries come from their high levels of antioxidants that fight free radical damage and protect our cells.\nRecent research also indicates that cherries help remove excess body fat and increase melatonin.\nNext time you roam the aisles of the grocery store, pick up some fresh, frozen or dried cherries and reap their many health benefits.\nNot only are cherries low in calories, but research suggests that they help reduce the concentration of fats in your blood too.\nIn a 2009 study published in the Journal of Medical Food, rats that received whole tart cherry powder for 90 days, mixed into a high-fat diet, didn’t gain as much weight or build up as much body fat as rats that didn’t receive cherries.\nTart cherry intake was associated with reduced concentration of fats in the blood, percentage fat mass and abdominal fat weight.\nBy consuming tart cherry juice or a cherry supplement, you reduce inflammation and lipids in the blood, which lead to heart conditions and weight gain.\nThe antioxidants found in cherries are known to improve cardiovascular health.\nResearch done at the University of Michigan suggests that tart cherries provide cardiovascular benefits and can reduce the risk of stroke.\nThe study showed that tart cherries activate peroxisome proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) isoforms in many of the body’s tissues.\n(3) Research also suggests that the anthocyanins and fiber in cherries contribute to heart health by reducing metabolic risk factors, improving LDL cholesterol levels and benefiting glucose metabolism.\nTheir presence help make cherries a high-antioxidant food.\nIn fact, a study published in the Journal of Natural Products found that the anthocyanins and cyanidin isolated from tart cherries exhibited better anti-inflammatory activity than aspirin.\n(5) Anthocyanins from sour cherries have been shown to not only possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, but to inhibit tumor development in mice and the growth of human colon cancer cell lines.\nThe body uses antioxidants to prevent itself from the damage caused by oxygen, which plays a major role in diseases today and has been linked to health conditions like cancer, heart disease and dementia.\n(6) Another one of the benefits of cherries is they fight free radicals that damage the eyes.\nCherries serve as a natural treatment for macular degeneration and natural treatment for glaucoma because of their powerful antioxidants that help prevent eye damage.\nBenefits of cherries for skin include their ability to reduce inflammatory conditions that affect your skin, improve elasticity and reduce signs of aging.\nA study published in Arthritis & Rheumatism evaluated 633 individuals with gout who were treated with cherry extract over a two-day period.\nThis cherry treatment was associated with a 35 percent lower risk of gout attacks.\nWhen cherry intake was combined with allopurinol use, a prescribed medication for gout and kidney stones, the risk of gout attacks was 75 percent lower.\n(8) Cherries are one of the top anti-inflammatory foods.\nThis is thought to be because of the anti-inflammatory properties of tart cherries.\n(11) Plus, cherries are beneficial during pregnancy because they provide potassium, which is needed to help keep your fluid and chemical balance as your blood volume expands.\nA study done at the Osteoarthritis Research Center evaluated 58 non-diabetic patients with osteoarthritis who drank two eight-ounce bottles of tart cherry juice daily for six weeks.\nAs a result of the study, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (known as WOMAC) scores decreased significantly after the tart cherry juice treatment.\nThis suggests that the tart cherry juice provided symptom relief for patients with osteoarthritis.\n(12) A 2015 study published in the journal Cell Stress & Chaperones found that when 20 osteoarthritis patients received sour topical cherry seed extract, which is a major protectant against oxidative stress, they experienced significantly less joint pain.\n(13) Tart cherry juice contains high levels of phytochemicals, including melatonin, a molecule critical in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.\nIn a study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, 20 volunteers consumed either a placebo or tart cherry juice concentrate for seven days.\nAs a result of this treatment, total melatonin content was significantly elevated in the cherry juice group.\nThis data suggests that tart cherry juice or supplements can benefit sleeping patterns and help people with disrupted sleep or those who can’t sleep.\nOne of the benefits of cherries is that they’re a nutrient-dense food that’s rich in anthocyanins, quercetin, hydroxycinnamates, potassium, carotenoids and melatonin.\nOne of the most powerful benefits of cherries is its high antioxidant content.\nCherries are widely available in grocery stores, especially when they are in season during the summer months.\nThey are known to be the most delicious type of cherry because of their natural sweetness.\nThere are a ton of fun and healthy ways to use cherries.\nJust use a knife, and cut the cherry in half — the pit will come right out.\nThe healthiest way to preserve cherries is in plain water.\nThis Very Cherry Snack Bar is a great way to get kids the antioxidants that they need.\nThe sweet cherry has been consumed since prehistoric times.\nConsuming sweet and tart cherries is completely safe for adults and children.\nThere are no known cherry interactions at this time."

        "0": "The chicken industry is committed to environmentally responsible and sustainable chicken production practices to ensure a healthier planet.\nFor the chicken industry, sustainability means being responsible stewards of land, water and feed management, and maintaining and advocating for the humane treatment of our most important asset: our chickens.\nThrough continuous innovation and by ensuring the best possible bird health, the chicken industry has been able to significantly reduce the use of water, farmland, electricity, greenhouse gasses, and other valuable resources.\nChicken production has a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other animal agriculture industry, and we are continuing to develop and advance our sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices so that we leave the earth in better shape than we found it.\nWe have made significant strides in minimizing environmental impact with the help of technological advancements and improved animal husbandry practices.\nGrowout houses, the barns where broiler chickens live and grow, are equipped with computer systems that measure and monitor water usage on the farm.\nYou may be surprised to learn that growing corn and soybeans for the production of chicken feed is the largest source of water consumption in chicken production.\nIn order to produce 1 pound of chicken, it only takes about 1.82 pounds of feed, one of the best rates in all of US animal agriculture.\nThat might not sound like a lot, but when you are feeding 9 billion chickens each year, that’s a lot of land, water and emissions we are saving.\nAll of these factors result in chicken requiring less feed and water to grow to market weight which results in chicken having less of an environmental impact.\nNutrient Management Plans are generally required for all agricultural land used to produce plants, food, feed, fiber, animals or other agricultural products.\nThese Nutrient Management Plans protect water quality by ensuring that farmers and urban land managers apply fertilizers, animal manure and other nutrient sources in an effective and environmentally sound manner.\nFarmers also minimize water runoff and emissions by planting vegetative buffers between chicken houses, which help to absorb any water, dust or emissions on the farm.\nLitter that farmers do not immediately use is placed in a shed which further ensures that the litter does not enter local water sources.\nSome chicken farmers are also installing solar panels in order to limit their energy use.\nFor example, Terri Wolf-King installed solar panels on her farm to help lower their energy bill and decrease their environmental footprint.\nIn fact, chicken production is extremely local; the distance from the hatchery to the farm to the processing plant is usually no more than one hour away from one another.\nLocalized production between the hatchery, farm and processing plant reduces time traveled, emissions and costs.\nThe chicken industry remains committed to reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of natural resources and byproducts of poultry production that contribute to climate change.\nFor farmers, there are many solutions to help improve air quality on their farms and reduce ammonia.\nCertain levels of ammonia in the chicken house can be damaging to the chicken, the farmer and the environment.\nFor this reason, farmers use litter treatments to aid in the retention of ammonia in litter, as well as ventilation and monitors to ensure the health of their flock.\nThe broiler chicken industry is committed to meeting that rising demand for consumers, while ensuring we are using practices that lessen our environmental impact.\nThe chicken industry is continuously looking for new ways to reduce our use of natural resources and improve the sustainability of our practices – and we know that advancements in production technology should never come at the expense of the health of our birds or of the people we’re feeding.\nWe are already headed in the right direction – chicken production has a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other animal agriculture industry, and we are continuing to develop and advance our sustainable practices so that we leave the earth in better shape than we found it.",

        "1": "The following data, sourced from the USDA Food Composition Databases, displays the nutritional values per 100 grams of raw chicken.\nCreatine is a compound that the human body produces naturally from three amino acids; arginine, glycine, and methionine (5).\nResearch shows that we can expect to find around 850 mg of creatine per 200 gram serving of skinless chicken breast (7).\nFor example, 100 grams of chicken breast provides more than 23 grams of protein for only 110 calories (1).\nAlthough foods like bacon and fatty steak are delicious, they can’t compete with chicken for protein density.\nSince chicken offers such a concentrated source of protein, it is an excellent dietary addition for anyone looking to increase their protein intake without consuming large amounts of extra calories.\nChicken provides a large amount of a compound called anserine.\nAnserine is a bioactive antioxidant compound found in a wide range of animal foods.\nHowever, anserine concentrates in muscle tissue, making chicken breast one of the very best sources (13).\nChicken meat contains a large amount of vitamin B3 (niacin), offering 56% of the RDI per 100 grams.\nWhile chicken is not quite as concentrated in B vitamins as red meat like beef and lamb, it is still a good source of them.\nGenerally speaking, the most concentrated sources of glycine include meat cuts from near the bone, skin, and connective tissues.\nTherefore, chicken thigh (including skin) is one of the very best dietary sources of glycine.\nNotably, research suggests that an optimal balance of methionine (found in muscle meat) and glycine may have longevity benefits.\nThe most concentrated mineral found in chicken meat is selenium.\nFurthermore, research suggests that sufficient selenium intake can help to increase blood antioxidant levels.\nChicken breast offers around 25% of the RDI for selenium per 100 grams (1).\nSince chicken meat is such a protein-dense food, it likely plays a beneficial role in improving levels of satiety.\nIn addition to its anserine content, chicken is also a good source of carnosine.\nInterestingly, existing research suggests that carnosine may have some useful health benefits, likely from its ability to bind excessive glucose in the blood (31).\nChicken breast contains close to 200 mg of carnosine per 100 grams (36).\nAs this article shows, chicken provides more nutritional benefits than many people believe.\nFirstly, it is high in protein, and it supplies a good range of vitamins and minerals.\nChicken meat also contains several bioactive compounds including anserine, carnosine, and creatine.\nWhile chicken isn’t quite as nutrient-rich as red meat, nutritionally it still has a lot to offer.\nSalmon and chicken are certainly good sources of protein.\nHowever, unlike you, I rarely eat the chicken without the skin – it’s just too tasty… Nutrition Advance provides evidence-based food and nutrition articles.",

        "1": "Chickpeas, also called garbanzo beans, are one of the oldest consumed crops in the world.\nIn fact, they have been a part of certain traditional diets for over 7,500 years, and it’s not hard to see why when you take into account the benefits of chickpeas nutrition.\nToday, chickpeas remain one of the most popular legumes across nearly every continent, and again, it’s not surprising why when we look at the benefits of chickpeas nutrition.\nChickpeas are a type of legume that offer a range of health benefits.\nChickpeas, or garbanzo beans, are a great source of plant-based protein along with fiber, iron, zinc, phosphorus, B vitamins and more.\nBeans, pulses and legumes are nutrient-dense foods and unique in that they provide a combination of protein, starch, fiber and minerals.\nYes, because the starch found in chickpeas is digested slowly and supports more stabilized blood sugar levels (more on this below).\nWith so many vitamins and nutrients, chickpeas benefit the body in a number of different ways.\nHere are the top eight benefits of chickpeas: Chickpeas, like all legumes, are a form of complex carbohydrate that the body is able to slowly digest and use for energy.\nEven very low-carb diets require you to get at least 25 grams of carbs per day, and a small serving of chickpeas can help to provide some of these carbohydrates.\nIn most cases, yes, because they are considered a “slow carb.” Chickpeas nutrition includes starch, which is a slow-burning carbohydrate that the body does not react to by suddenly spiking glucose in the blood.\nUnlike simple sugars — found in processed products like refined flour, white bread, pasta, soda, candy and most other packaged foods — the starches found in chickpeas take an extended period of time to break down once consumed.\nStarches contain natural sugars called glucose, which the body uses easily for many essential functions, but glucose can be troublesome for people who are prediabetic or who have diabetes.\nThe process of digesting and utilizing the glucose found in all beans and starches is drawn-out, which is extremely important for diabetics, who have trouble reaching a stable blood sugar level after contain sugars due to a resistance to insulin.\n(3) Chickpeas are high in both protein and fiber, which helps make you feel full, curb food cravings and hopefully reduce unhealthy snacking.\n(4) Beans make a filling addition to any recipe because of their fiber, complex carbs and protein.\nChickpeas nutrition has macronutrients that work together to give us a feeling of being full after eating, while also helping control our blood sugar levels and therefore maintaining our energy.\nFrequently consuming foods like fat-burning garbanzo beans is an excellent way to aid in healthy and sustainable weight loss.\nBecause they are so low in calories but high in essential fiber and protein, they are a perfect food for those that need to lose some weight but who are watching calorie intake.\nA major benefit of chickpeas nutrition is helping reduce constipation.\nFiber also helps balance pH levels and bacteria within the gut, increasing healthy bacteria while also decreasing unhealthy bacteria.\nThe high amount of fiber in garbanzo beans is responsible for its filling effect and helps improve digestion, but it does much more than this.\nFiber aids in heart health, helps control blood sugar levels, and guards against cancer, heart disease, diverticulosis, kidney stones, PMS, obesity and more.\nCardiologists’ favorite benefit of chickpeas nutrition is that it supports heart health in a number of ways.\nChickpeas have been shown to help balance unhealthy cholesterol levels, reduce hypertension and protect against heart disease in multiple ways.\nThis may be partially due to the high amount of fiber found in chickpeas nutrition, which helps people avoid overeating and gaining harmful excess weight, especially around the vital organs.\n(6) Fiber works to create a gel-like substance in the digestive system that binds with fatty acids, helping balance cholesterol levels.\nIn fact, studies show that having just one daily serving (about 3/4 cup cooked) of beans of any kind can help decrease chances of a heart attack and help balance “bad” LDL cholesterol.\nConsuming beans has also been shown in animal studies to have protective benefits against cancer, in particular colon cancer, due to their high fiber content.\n(9) Because beans keep the digestive system, including the colon, free from harmful bacteria and toxic buildup, they create a healthier overall environment where pH levels are balanced, inflammation is reduced and therefore cancer cells cannot proliferate like they can in an unhealthy environment.\nChickpeas nutrition boasts high levels of iron, zinc, folate, phosphorus and B vitamins, all of which are especially important for vegetarians and vegans who may be lacking in these essential nutrients due to avoiding animal products.\nIt also helps the body utilize other B Vitamins in addition to protein (in the form of amino acids).\nLegumes have an alkalizing effect on the body, which helps balance pH levels by combating the high level of acidity that is common in most modern, western diets.\nWhen chickpeas are combined with a source of healthy fat, like olive oil — which is the case with hummus — nutrient absorption is further increased.\nAdditionally, chickpeas are a good source of three nutrients that help to reduce common symptoms associated with PMS: magnesium, manganese and vitamin B6.\nProtein is an essential macronutrient that plays an important role in nearly every function in the body, including our vital organs, muscles, tissues and even hormone levels.\nChickpeas nutrition not only contains important protein, about 15 grams per cup of cooked beans, but also has many other nutrients and fiber too.\nChickpeas are often eaten with grains or vegetables, for example in stews or in hummus that is eaten with pita bread; these foods luckily work together to make up a “complete protein.” This means they contain all of the building blocks of protein, called essential amino acids, that are necessary for the body to acquire from food in order to use for body function and energy.\nChickpeas and garbanzo beans are the same things (from the same plant family) — they are just two different ways of describing the same legume.\nMany people feel that beans made from scratch- meaning from dried form- taste the best and hold their texture more so than precooked kinds.\nThe good news is that precooked beans, either in canned or frozen form, often have the same nutrient levels as freshly made beans, so as long as you buy a high-quality kind, you can conveniently enjoy beans even when you’re in a pinch.\nLook for dried chickpeas in the “bulk bin” section of your favorite health food store, where you will likely be able to find organic dried beans for sale at a very low cost.\nIt’s best to soak all dried beans overnight prior to cooking them, which helps make them more digestible, aids in absorption of their nutrients and decreases cooking time.\nSoaking and sprouting beans helps eliminate phytic acid and may greatly increase mineral absorption in addition to making the beans more digestible and less gas-forming.\nIn order to avoid consuming too high of levels of phytic acid, it’s best to buy organic beans that are also labeled GMO free, since phytic acid is much higher in foods grown using modern high-phosphate fertilizers than those grown in natural compost.\nAlso try soaking and sprouting your beans (and grains too) since this can help to reduce phytic acid by around 50–100 percent.\nIt’s believed that garbanzo beans were first consumed by Ancient Mediterranean populations between 7500–10,000 years ago and then spread to southern France and Germany shortly after.\nIt’s believed that centuries ago populations associated chickpeas with the philosophical god Venus because the beans were believed to offer powerful health benefits related to reproduction.\nPeople across the U.S. now

        "1": "Persons that consume the highest levels of vitamin B12 are also less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease, making it a great idea to ensure that we top up our intake of this important vitamin.\nA 3 ounce serving of clams supplies approximately 24 mg of iron, whereas the daily recommended intake for adult stands at about 8 mg.\nWhile we know you won’t be consuming clams every day, once a week or even per month is a great way to support your iron intake from other sources.\nIron helps to ensure that hemoglobin production is maintained, hemoglobin being the molecule that binds oxygen and carries it throughout the body.\nAs one may come to expect, clams are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, similar to their aquatic buddies the fishes.\nAgain, a 3 ounce serving of clams supplies approximately 140 mg of the omega-3 fatty acids, whereas daily intake of between 250 to 500 mg is recommended.\nIf you’re not a fan of fatty fish, or can’t stand the taste of the capsules, consumption of clams can help you come closer to your daily recommended intake.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are important for helping to support blood vessel flexibility, and reducing the likelihood of atherosclerotic plaques depositing on the inside of blood vessel walls, where they may occlude blood flow and increase your risk of strokes or heart attacks.\nSelenium lends itself to the production of many antioxidant enzymes in the body, which may just help to offset the inflammatory damage immune cells can cause to the joints.\nClams, like many other aquatic species, trap some of this mineral in the body, and condense it to become amongst the richest sources you can get via consumption.\nZinc is critically involved in a number of biochemical processes our body undergoes every single day, including detoxification, phagocytosis, and helping the immune system to produce white blood cells.\nOne of the easiest ways to go about helping support the production of collagen is to ensure your vitamin C requirements are met.\nVitamin C also improves the uptake of iron, which clams are already a great source of, and supports the immune system as well.\nTwo extremely important minerals for the production of sperm and seminal fluid in men are zinc and selenium, which are both abundantly found in clams.",

        "1": "Small but powerful, clementines pack a punch with their strong flavor and impressive health benefits.\nThis citrus hybrid blends the best aspects of mandarin oranges and sweet oranges into a small, juicy fruit that is easy to peel.\nThis variety includes seeds and is larger and sweeter than seedless types.\nTheir small size, easily removed peel, and sweet flavor make clementines a popular choice for parents who encourage their children to eat plenty of fresh fruits.\nClementines contain high levels of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, which play an important role in reducing inflammation.\nDiets high in anti-inflammatory foods, like clementines, may reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.\nHigh fiber intake encourages healthy digestion by adding bulk to your stool and making it easier to pass.\nToo little vitamin C can lead to reduced levels of hydrochloric acid, which helps your body break down and absorb nutrients.\nResearch reveals that people who eat citrus fruits on a regular basis are less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration.\nWhile flavonoids can be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, the type found in clementines seems to be especially powerful for promoting healthy eyes.\nMany of the fruit’s health benefits are due to its high vitamin C content.\nThis important vitamin helps with several key systems in your body, including your immune system.\nClementines are also rich in flavonoids—plant compounds that can help reduce inflammation.\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition: \"Dietary Flavonoids and the Prevalence and 16-y Incidence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\" Duquesne University Center for Spiritan Studies: \"The Spiritan Connection to the Clementine Fruit.\" Harvard Women's Health Watch: \"Foods That Fight Inflammation.\" © 2005 - 2021 WebMD LLC.",
        "2": "Clementines may be small in size, but there’s nothing miniature about their nutritional offerings or health benefits.\nA part of the mandarin family, clementines are often thought of as “tiny oranges\" (and sold with names like \"Cuties\" and \"Sweeties\").\nThe same serving also provides about 6.8 grams of sugar, but since clementines are naturally sweet, there are no added sugars.\nClementines, like most other citrus fruits, are low in protein.\nLike most citrus fruits, they’re high in vitamin C.\nA single clementine provides 60% of the daily recommended intake of this important vitamin.\n(Men need 90 milligrams per day.)2﻿ Clementines are also rich in potassium, providing 131 milligrams per serving of one fruit (to compare, a small banana has about 360 milligrams).\nThere are 36 micrograms in one clementine, or about 10% of the daily recommended value, for both women and men.3﻿ Beta-cryptoxanthin is a carotenoid often found in fruits and vegetables that are red, orange (like clementines), or yellow in color.\nBeta-cryptoxanthin also acts as an antioxidant.4﻿ In addition to the nutrients clementines offer, there are a host of health effects they have as well.\nSome research also suggests vitamin C also has an effect on pneumonia.6﻿ There are a number of published studies linking citrus fruit intake with a reduced risk of cancer.\nOne study found that eating citrus fruit reduced the risk of breast cancer by 10%.\nOther research has shown citrus fruit consumption protects against pancreatic, esophageal, and stomach cancer.7﻿ The mechanism isn’t fully understood—one hypothesis is that the vitamin C in citrus fruits can deactivate carcinogens (cancer-causing agents).8﻿ As we age, bones become more brittle because there is less formation of new bone as well as continuing resorption of existing bones.\nStudies have shown that beta-cryptoxanthin stimulates bone growth while also reducing bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mass.9﻿ Maintaining healthy skin goes beyond anti-aging and aesthetics.\nAnd our skin naturally contains high concentrations of vitamin C.\nThe vitamin acts as an antioxidant, protecting our skin from UV damage as well as stimulating collagen growth.10﻿ Research also shows vitamin C is important for maintaining a healthy collagen/elastin balance, which becomes more difficult to maintain as we age.\nThe vitamin plays a role in every stage of wound healing from reducing inflammation to collagen formation, and even reducing scar tissue.11﻿ Hesperidin is a plant compound found in clementines that may play a role in cognitive health, along with vitamin C.\nThrough this mechanism, hesperidin may help keep the brain tissue healthy.12﻿ Similar to how vitamin C is naturally found in high concentrations in our skin, it’s also found concentrated in our brains and spinal fluid.\nThe exact role vitamin C plays with cognition is still unknown, but the nutrient may help protect our brains as they age, specifically in older adults with insufficient vitamin C intake.13﻿ Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies among Americans, especially women ages 19 to 50 and adolescent girls.14﻿ In our diet, there are two types of iron: heme (from animal sources) and non-heme (from plant sources).\nNon-heme iron is not absorbed as well as heme iron, but vitamin C is one nutrient that can help the process.\nEating foods rich in vitamin C while eating non-heme iron foods, such as a spinach salad with bell peppers, increases the non-heme iron absorption 3- to 6-fold.15﻿ Although it is not one of the more common food allergies, citrus allergy does exist.\nThere are different components specifically within citrus fruits that may cause allergic reactions.\nIf you’re allergic to citrus, you should discuss your restrictions with your doctor.16﻿ Grapefruit, a member of the citrus family, is one of the most common foods to have interactions with drugs.\nSome fruit juices, including clementine juice, may also interact with medications.\nDiscuss these interactions with your doctor.17﻿ Mandarins are a type of orange, but they are in a category of their own—along with clementines and tangerines.\nThese fruits tend to have thin, easy-to-peel skin and are smaller in size compared to oranges.\nOunce-for-ounce, oranges, and clementines have about the same number of calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat.\nThey only vary slightly when it comes to some nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, folate, calcium, and potassium, although the differences are not remarkable.18﻿ Like most citrus fruits, clementines are in season during the winter months, November to February—though you can often find them in supermarkets year-round.\nAlthough citrus fruits are not generally associated with food-borne illnesses, contamination is possible.\nNational Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements Vitamin C fact sheet for

        "1": "There are several attempts being made to replace the sustainability of providing the milk and creamer needs of the world's population away from the traditional animal-based sources of dairy production; and coconut production is one of the best eco-friendly alternatives.\nSeveral studies have indicated the adverse effect of dairy sourcing from cows on global warming due to their substantial release of massive amounts of dangerous greenhouse gases, which include methane and nitrous oxide through their feces and burps.\nThis is because high-production dairy cows each need to eat up to 120 pounds of wet feed a day and up to 55 pounds of dry matter such as baled hay and grain mix.\nIn 2018, a study at the University of Oxford concluded that the best action we can take to stop the environmental footprint of livestock is to stop (or limit) our use of dairy products and consumption of meat.\nIf you are a regular consumer of milk and creamers, you can still get these products from coconuts.\nNot only are coconuts a perfect source of milk and creamer products, but every part of the coconut tree is useful in the sense that they are also used for the manufacture of other essential products that we need in our lives.\nThis is not to say that milk and creamer sourced from coconut production doesn't have environmental impact.",
        "2": "It has gone from being an exotic tropical fruit, limited to desserts and the occasional pina colada, to an important pantry staple in its many forms ― coconut oil, water, milk, cream, sugar, flour, flakes, chips and more.\nWhile environmentalists encourage people to eat locally, sustainably and with a minimal carbon footprint, there is nothing local ― or usually even continental ― about the consumption of coconut in the United States and Europe, the largest importers of coconut products.\nThe demand for coconuts in developed countries is putting a strain on their natural sustainable production by farmers in the developing world.\n“We end up creating a monocrop plantation that will wipe out all other crops,” said Tomy Mathew, founder of Fair Trade Alliance Kerala and an Indian fair trade and organic certified company that exports coconut products to the U.S. and Europe.\nMathew noted that large plantations in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for example, are located in already water-starved regions whose water supplies are now being depleted “at an alarming rate to irrigate these farms.” “As it happened with cocoa, as with vanilla, that sort of resource-intensive production is not sustainable in the long run,” Mathew said.\nFarmers working vanilla and cocoa plantations in the Indian state of Kerala saw tremendous loss of income when the prices for those commodities crashed.\nOften by the time the fruits are ready, the trend has already passed, forcing poorer farmers to farm chemically to get faster results.” She pointed, as an example, to the environmental costs of chemically grown avocados in Mexico, planted to feed the avocado boom in the U.S. Coconut trees have a productive life of 30 to 40 years.\nWith many of their trees long past peak productivity, the coconut farming industry in Asia has been plagued with low yields for years.\n“Most planters are shying away from coconut production as a result of exorbitant wages being demanded to climb coconut trees and de-husk nuts,” said Mathew Jose, founder of the company Farm Origin.\nHe said market conditions in Kerala, the highest coconut-producing state in India, are one of the big reasons that production is on the decline.\n“Farmers in that region are choosing instead to either commercialize their land or grow exotic fruit trees (rambutan, mangosteen) to increase revenue,” he said.\nTomy Mathew explained that aggregators and middlemen in the coconut trade drive fluctuations in the market price of coconut, which eventually affects farmers’ livelihoods.\nUnless it’s a supply chain that promises a fair price to the primary producer, I would look at this product with a huge question mark,” Mathew said.\n“It’s extremely important to ask questions about sustainable supply chains,” said Mathew, stressing the need for people to hold accountable the brands they patronize.\nIn particular, he suggested looking for brands that try to ensure fair prices for coconut farmers and encourage multi-crop farming."

        "1": "Research suggests that coconut meat provides nutritious fats and various other potential health benefits.\nThe meat is said to, among other things: Researchers have studied some, but not all, of the potential health benefits of coconut.\nCoconut meat contains large amounts of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), a type of saturated fat that is much easier for the human body to digest than animal fats.\nThe MCFAs found in coconut meat also contain antimicrobial properties.\nAlthough eating coconut meat is not a substitute for proper dental hygiene, it can help kill some of the unwanted bacteria found in your mouth and protect your gums and teeth from infection or cavities.\nRegularly eating coconut meat might help with weight loss.\nThe MCFAs widely found in coconut meat are associated with fat burning.\nAlthough coconut meat provides highly valuable nutrients, the food contains moderate amounts of saturated fats, so it's best to enjoy it in moderation.\nIf you're looking to avoid or cut back on saturated fats, rather than using coconut meat as a snack, choose something that's high in healthy fats, like nuts, seeds, or avocados.",
        "2": "In the United States, fresh whole coconut is considered an exotic food and is mostly consumed by health enthusiasts.\nDespite being high in saturated fat, coconuts provide manganese and fiber.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one piece (45g) of fresh coconut meat measuring 2\" x 2\" x 1/2\".\n1﻿ One piece of fresh, unsweetened coconut meat has just 6.8 carbs, most of which is insoluble fiber—an indigestible form of dietary carbohydrate.\nInsoluble fiber provides bulk to stool, and can help prevent constipation and the development of hemorrhoids.2﻿ There is a small amount of naturally-occurring sugar in coconut, but just 2.8 grams per serving.\nThe glycemic load of a single serving of fresh coconut meat is estimated to be about 6.\nThere are 15 grams of fat in a single serving of coconut meat.\nCoconut is one of the highest plant-based sources of saturated fat.\nSaturated fat is the type mainly derived from meat protein.\nIt is associated with hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and heart disease.3﻿ There has been substantial discussion in health and research settings about the relative risks and benefits of the different types of fat in coconut and coconut oil.\nCoconut provides medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs).4﻿ MCFAs are considered by some to be healthier than long-chain fatty acids (found in meat and dairy sources).\nCoconut meat is not a rich source of protein, but it provides about 1.5 grams per piece.\nA single serving of coconut meat provides 34% of the daily value for manganese, a mineral that helps your body maintain a healthy brain, nervous system, and immune function.\nKeep in mind that while you may gain certain coconut oil benefits when you consume coconut meat.\nSome proponents of coconut oil believe that it is far better for your health than consuming other forms of saturated fat.\nThis type of fat breaks down faster and does not accumulate in the bloodstream as much as the long-chain fatty acids found in meat and dairy products.\nBut studies have shown that coconut oil can raise your LDL cholesterol.\nOne published study found that coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol less than butter, but significantly more than unsaturated plant oils.5﻿ However, there is some potentially positive evidence regarding coconut oil and HDL levels.\nSome studies have found that consuming coconut oil can boost HDL levels.\nResearchers suggest that the HDL increase may be due to the high levels of both lauric acid and myristic acid.6﻿ Research published in the July 2018 issue of the Journal of Food Science suggests that the fatty acids in coconut contain powerful antioxidants that help boost immune function and reduce systemic inflammation in the body.\nStudy authors note that these antioxidants may help protect the body from infections.7﻿ Many fans of coconut and coconut oil claim that it can help you to slim down.\nA 2018 review of studies supported certain weight-loss related claims, suggesting that the medium chain triglycerides in coconut and coconut oil could enhance fat burning, increased energy expenditure, and even suppress appetite, but only if included as part of a low-fat diet.8﻿ Another analysis of studies published in 2015 compared consumption of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) such as those found in coconut oil with long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) for the purposes of weight loss.\nStudy authors noted, however, that further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm these findings and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition.9﻿ There are numerous controversial claims that coconut can prevent heart disease.\nMany of these claims are based on the fact that people from tropical areas where coconuts are widely consumed traditionally had a lower risk for heart disease.\nAccording to epidemiological research published in 1981, Tokelauans, for whom coconut represents 60% of the daily diet, had no evidence of heart disease or hypercholesterolemia despite the high intake of lauric and myristic acid.10﻿ But researchers also point out that these people also ate diets rich in fish and plant foods.5﻿ Many scientists now believe that the cardioprotective properties of coconut consumption have been exaggerated.11﻿ In fact, a large review of studies found little evidence supporting the fact that consuming coconut or coconut oil (instead of unsaturated oil) reduced the risk for heart disease.5﻿ More recent claims that coconut meat, coconut milk, or coconut oil can boost mental function in people with Alzheimer's disease remains largely unsupported.\nCoconut and coconut oil are known to provide antioxidants12﻿ These antioxidants may help reduce oxidative stress and lower the risk of metabolic and aging-related diseases by eliminating free radicals that cause cell damage.13﻿ Coconut allergy is rare but can occur, particularly in people with a known allergy to walnuts or other tree nuts.14﻿ If an allergy were to occur, it would most likely be in the form of contact dermatitis, an allergic reaction caused when coconut or coconut oil comes into contact with skin.\nLess commonly, people may experience a food allergy after eating coconut.\nAnaphylaxis, a potentially deadly all-body reaction, is exceptionally rare when eating coconut, according to a 2017 study from Texas College Hospital.15﻿ Even so, coconuts are classified as nuts by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and must be disclosed as a possible allergen on food product labels.\nThere are no known drug interactions to coconut or coconut oil.\nIt can take a lot of work to extract coconut meat from the whole fruit so many people purchase coconut either freshly shredded or dried and shredded.\nA one-ounce serving of dried shredded coconut has slightly more calories than a serving of fresh coconut.\nA half-cup (100 grams) of shredded, sweetened coconut provides 500 calories, nearly 48 grams of carbohydrate, 43 grams of sugar, 35 grams of fat, and 2.8 grams of protein.17﻿ The

It's a hypoxic, oxygen-deprived area where, essentially, there's no room for aquatic life, and we know from our study that corn production contributes to 40 percent of that nitrogen pollution.\" \"The reality is that, in some of these regions, groundwater is going to continue to be a source of irrigation, but there are many upgrades in irrigation technologies that can be employed.\nThe fact is that 20 percent of farmers are still using old-fashioned flood mechanisms to irrigate their corn rather than using drip irrigation or center-pivots, which are much more parsimonious in how water is being allocated.\nThere's a lot they can also do to protect soil and the moisture in their soil by not plowing their soil as vigorously as they might otherwise, by doing things like planting cover crops.\" \"Fertilizer application is something that has been studied for many, many years, and there are many great practices that have been identified by scientists and agricultural experts.\nSo there's a risk for them, but we now have technologies, soil testing approaches, and even remote sensing that allows farmers to be much more precise about where, when and how much they apply fertilizer.\" This segment aired on June 11, 2014.",
        "1": "“The deaths caused per bushel in western corn belt states such as Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska tend to be lower than in eastern corn belt states such as Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio,” commented lead researcher Jason Hill (UMN).\n“Farmers can greatly improve the environmental profile of their corn by using precision agriculture tools and switching to fertilizers that have lower ammonia emissions.” Nitrogen fertilizer use has led to increased concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere, a side effect of the PM2.5 precursor ammonia.\n“It’s important for farmers to have this information so that they can implement practices that reduce the environmental impact of the crops they grow,” explained Hill; “Farmers can greatly improve the environmental profile of their corn by using precision agriculture tools and switching to fertilizers that have lower ammonia emissions.” In their paper, recently published in Nature Sustainability, the researchers propose further beneficial strategic interventions for improving future corn production; reduced fertilizer use, improved nitrogen use efficiency and changing the areas where the corn is grown may all contribute to improving the cost to benefit ratio.",
        "2": "New research led by the Institute on the Environment’s NorthStar Initiative for Sustainable Enterprise drills down to the county-level impact of corn production, connecting it for the first time to where corn likely winds up – based on the facility-specific demand of large-scale U.S. corn consumers, which include meat and ethanol producers.\nPublished in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the innovative research reveals that the environmental impact of corn varies significantly across geographic consumption locations of sectors and individual producers.\n“Our approach significantly improves supply-chain transparency – and provides a starting place for companies that are interested in better managing their upstream environmental impacts.” The researchers, led by Timothy Smith, a professor in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering and an IonE Fellow, used publicly available data from 2007 and 2012 to paint a granular picture of corn’s impact across the United States, revealing which counties use the most irrigation water and produce the most greenhouse gas emissions per bushel.\nConnecting this data to corn consumers through a newly developed NiSE tool (foods3.org), revealed insights into the impacts of corn consumption across counties, states, industry sectors, and meat and ethanol companies, as well as individual facilities."

cereal grain, as it’s rich in fiber and many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\nHere are the nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of boiled yellow corn (1Trusted Source): Like all cereal grains, corn is primarily composed of carbs.\nDespite the sugar in sweet corn, it is not a high-glycemic food, ranking low or medium on the glycemic index (GI) (3).\nWhile the fiber content of different types of corn varies, it’s generally around 9–15% of the dry weight (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nThe fat content of corn ranges from 5–6%, making it a low-fat food (1Trusted Source, 5).\nRefined corn oil is mainly composed of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, while monounsaturated and saturated fats make up the rest (9Trusted Source).\nIt also contains significant amounts of vitamin E, ubiquinone (Q10), and phytosterols, increasing its shelf life and making it potentially effective at lowering cholesterol levels (10, 11Trusted Source).\nIn general, popcorn is rich in minerals, whereas sweet corn is higher in many vitamins.\nA highly popular snack, popcorn is one of the most common whole-grain foods in the United States.\nMore frequently, whole grains are consumed as food ingredients, such as in breads and tortillas (27Trusted Source).\nWhole-grain foods may have several health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nHowever, regular popcorn consumption has not been linked to improved heart health (27Trusted Source).\nEven though popcorn is healthy on its own, it’s often eaten with sugary soft drinks and frequently loaded with added salt and high-calorie cooking oils, all of which may harm your health over time (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nIt’s a popular snack food that’s categorized as a whole-grain cereal.\nDietary intake of antioxidants, most notably carotenoids like zeaxanthin and lutein, may boost eye health (25Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHigh levels of these carotenoids in your blood are strongly linked to a reduced risk of both macular degeneration and cataracts (41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\nObservational studies likewise suggest that high dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin may be protective, but not all studies support this (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source).\nOne study in 356 middle-aged and older adults found a 43% reduction in the risk of macular degeneration in those with the highest intake of carotenoids, especially lutein and zeaxanthin, compared to those with the lowest intake (45Trusted Source).\nPopcorn and other high-fiber foods were once believed to trigger this condition (47Trusted Source).\nMen who ate the most popcorn were 28% less likely to develop diverticular disease than those with the lowest intake (48Trusted Source).\nAs a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, corn may help maintain your eye health.\nWhile usually not a problem for people who follow a well-balanced diet, it may be a serious concern in developing countries where cereal grains and legumes are staple foods.\nThey occur in stored cereals worldwide, but adverse health effects have mostly been linked to the consumption of corn and corn products — especially among people who depend on corn as their main dietary staple (53).\nOne observational study in South Africa indicates that regular consumption of cornmeal may increase the risk of cancer of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (58Trusted Source).\nIn April 2004, 125 people died in Kenya from aflatoxin poisoning after eating homegrown corn that had been improperly stored (59Trusted Source).\nThe symptoms of gluten intolerance include fatigue, bloating, diarrhea, and weight loss (60Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that corn zein caused an inflammatory reaction in a subgroup of people with celiac disease.\nFor this reason, scientists have hypothesized that corn intake may, in rare cases, be the cause of persistent symptoms in some people with celiac disease (62Trusted Source).\nCorn has also been reported to be a symptom trigger in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or FODMAP intolerance (63Trusted Source).\nAs a good source of antioxidant carotenoids, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, yellow corn may promote eye health.\nIt’s also a rich source of many vitamins and minerals.\nFor this reason, moderate consumption of whole-grain corn, such as popcorn or sweet corn, can be an excellent addition to a healthy diet.\nThough corn is undeniably a popular vegetable and cereal grain, you may wonder whether it's healthy.\nThis article reviews corn oil, including its nutrition, uses… High-fructose corn syrup has been linked to many serious health issues, including today's obesity epidemic.\nThis article provides an overview of popcorn’s nutrition, the ketogenic…

Division of Marine Fisheries statistics.\nThe need to investigate the causes of this decline is important not only to the economy of North Carolina, but also to the health of marine and estuarine ecosystems along the southeastern Atlantic coast.\nIn the lab run by Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, we are investigating the health of blue crabs from different estuaries along the North and South Carolina coasts, incorporating analysis of water and sediment chemistry in those areas.\nCompounds that enter waterways from agricultural, industrial and terrestrial uses are capable of exerting a wide range of negative influences on aquatic organisms.\nThe importance of such an investigation is not restricted merely to impacts on aquatic organisms such as the blue crab, but rather applies to ecosystem-wide health.\nMy research involves exposing larval and juvenile blue crabs to different concentrations of these two compounds over a period of time and then using genetic markers to evaluate differences in development.\nVery small concentrations of compounds entering waterways are capable of causing negative effects on a variety of aquatic invertebrates.\nTherefore, establishing a link between concentrations of insecticides in coastal waters and the health of blue crab populations could provide us with an early indicator of human health problems that may occur in the future."

To help you be well, we’ll send you honest talk about women’s bodies, and beauty, nutrition, and fitness advice.\nUTIs are among the most common bacterial infections — especially among women (15Trusted Source).\ncoli from attaching to the lining of your bladder and urinary tract, making cranberries a potential preventive measure against UTIs (13, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nIn fact, cranberries are among the richest fruit sources of proanthocyanidins — especially the A-type (14Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nA number of human studies indicate that drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry supplements may reduce the risk of UTIs in both children and adults (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).\nNot all cranberry products are effective against UTIs. In fact, proanthocyanidins may be lost during processing, making them undetectable in many products (35Trusted Source).\nOn the other hand, cranberry supplements — which contain sufficient amounts of A-type proanthocyanidins — may be a useful preventive strategy.\nCranberry juice and supplements may reduce your risk of UTIs. However, they do not treat this infection.\nStomach cancer is a common cause of cancer-related death worldwide (36Trusted Source).\nCranberries contain unique plant compounds known as A-type proanthocyanidins, which may cut your risk of stomach cancer by preventing H.\npylori in about 17% of those infected (41Trusted Source).\npylori in about 17% of those infected (41Trusted Source).\nIn human studies, cranberry juice or extracts have proven beneficial for various heart disease risk factors.\nIf consumed regularly, cranberries or cranberry juice may reduce your risk of stomach cancer.\nThe juice and extract also improve several risk factors for heart disease, including cholesterol levels and blood pressure.\nHowever, excessive consumption may cause stomach upset and diarrhea — and may also increase the risk of kidney stones in predisposed individuals.\nMost kidney stones are made of calcium oxalate, so excessive amounts of oxalate in your urine is one of the main risk factors (56Trusted Source).\nFor this reason, they are considered a risk factor for kidney stones when consumed in high amounts (57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).\nHigh consumption of cranberries may increase the risk of kidney stones in predisposed individuals.\nSome of these compounds may help prevent UTIs, stomach cancer, and heart disease.",

        "2": "Did you know that cranberries contain one of the highest concentrations of antioxidants of any fruit?\nThat’s right — these incredible berries are loaded with health-promoting antioxidants, which help protect cells against free radical damage and aid in the prevention of chronic disease.\n(1) Cranberries should be a staple on every shopping list for many reasons, including their ability to reduce body-wide inflammation, boost immunity and more.\nOne of the most well-known cranberry benefits is its ability to act as a home remedy for urinary tract infections (UTIs).\nCranberry fruit is thought to contain specific compounds that prevent bacteria from attaching to the inner surface of the urinary tract or bladder.\n(4) For this reason, many health professionals recommend drinking one to two glasses of 100 percent pure, unsweetened or lightly sweetened cranberry juice a day to aid in the prevention of urinary tract infections.\nStudies offer evidence that women who drink cranberry juice frequently may suffer fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections.\n(5, 6) Cranberry juice, capsules and tablets are good alternatives to antibiotics, which come with a slew of adverse side effects like yeast infections, digestive issues and antibiotic resistance.\nWhen reviewers compared cranberry juice, capsules or tablets with a placebo or water for the prevention of UTIs in a variety of populations, results showed that over a 12-month period, cranberry products reduced the overall incidence of UTIs by 35 percent.\nFortunately, anti-inflammatory foods like cranberries can help naturally combat inflammation thanks to their rich content of antioxidants.\nAll berries help fight free radicals thanks to their antioxidant content, but cranberries are one of the top sources.\nA diet low in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory foods results in an abundance of free radicals within the body.\nLoading up on antioxidant-rich foods like cranberries is an easy way to fight the effects of free radicals and relieve inflammation.\nResearch shows that cranberries contain cancer-fighting substances that may be helpful in preventing the growth of breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer cells.\nIn fact, both human and animal studies show that cranberries may help slow tumor progression and block the growth of cancer cells.\n(8, 9) Coupled with their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cranberries may help lower the risk of some of the most common types of cancers.\nThe high levels of proanthocyanidins that are found in cranberries help the body’s immune function ward off illness and disease.\n(10) One of the biggest benefits of cranberry juice is its ability to ward off harmful bacteria and keep it from accumulating and growing in the gut lining.\nThis allows healthy, immune-boosting bacteria to thrive and create a powerful defense against illness and infection.\nIn fact, studies show that it could reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of conditions like pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea.\nRecent research shows that cranberry benefits help optimize the balance of bacteria in the entire digestive tract.\nCranberries act similarly to how probiotics found in kombucha, kefir or yogurt do to create an environment of healthy “gut flora.” (12) Digestive health benefits from cranberries are undeniable because of the fruit’s ability to balance bacteria in the body.\nThis not only relieves symptoms like constipation, diarrhea and stomach acid, but also helps boost immunity and nutrient absorption by fostering the health of the gut microbiome.\n(13) Studies show that adding cranberries to your diet could come with a number of benefits to heart health due to their ability to block blood clotting, reduce blood pressure and decrease inflammation.\n(14) In one study, consuming low-calorie cranberry juice was found to reduce several risk factors of heart disease, including blood pressure, triglyceride levels, inflammation and insulin resistance.\n(15) Other research shows that cranberries and cranberry juice could also help lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, increase beneficial HDL cholesterol and prevent a stiffening of the arteries in people with heart disease.\nMany of these phytonutrients offer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer health benefits.\nOne cup (about 110 grams) of chopped, raw cranberries contains approximately: (19) Along with an impressive amount of vitamins and minerals, cranberries also boast high levels of phytonutrients.\nSome of the most powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants in cranberries include: Cranberries have long been used in traditional medicine and are believed to treat a wide variety of conditions and ailments.\nHistorically, Native Americans used cranberries to manage bleeding, promote digestive health and treat conditions like urinary tract infections.\nAdditionally, while raspberries and blueberries are often enjoyed fresh as is, cranberries are typically dried or used in baked goods to take advantage of their incredibly unique flavor.\nAll three are rich in antioxidants as well as important nutrients, like vitamin C and fiber.\nFor best results, include a good mix of all three in your diet, plus a variety of other fruits and veggies, to maximize the wide range of potential health benefits found in each.\nThis distinct cranberry color indicates that the fruit contains a higher concentration of the beneficial anthocyanin compounds.\nThe health benefits of cranberries seem to be present most in raw form, but any way of eating whole cranberries usually still provides great benefits.\nFrequently, cranberries are processed into products such as juices, canned sauces, sugary jams and sweetened dried cranberries.\nFor starters, you can enjoy cranberries in a homemade trail mix by adding dried cranberries to a mixture of other health-promoting nuts and seeds.\nAlthough cooked cranberries have many health benefits, they retain their maximum amount of nutrients and taste when they are fresh, allowing you to maximize the potential cranberry juice benefits.\nHere are a few classic cranberry recipes to try at home: Cranberry pills and capsules are often used as a natural treatment for conditions like urinary tract infections.\nThey have been shown to be effective in the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections.\nIt’s believed that even in early Native American times, cranberries were commonly eaten for their digestive support and ability to keep people from developing infections and becoming sick."

        "1": "Heavy cream is a thick, delicious dairy product that seems to make everything taste better.\nDespite its taste, heavy cream has traditionally had a bad reputation due to its high-fat content.\nFirstly, heavy cream is a minimally processed dairy product that comes from milk.\nThe production process of cream is very simple and involves skimming the high-butterfat top layer from regular milk.\nAs the table shows, heavy cream has a butterfat content of at least 36%, but it may range up to 40%.\nThe data source is the USDA’s FoodData Central database (5): As shown above, heavy cream provides a large amount of (primarily saturated) fat.\nHeavy cream is an excellent source of vitamin A (retinol) in its most bioavailable form.\nIn truth, natural sources of fat, in reasonable amounts, are nothing to fear and even have benefits for our health.\nDietary fat is important for many processes in our body, so we should acknowledge that it offers health benefits.\nWith its high-fat content, heavy cream perfectly fits this profile (8, 9).\nHeavy cream contains calcium, a mineral that plays an important role in skeletal health.\nWhile both cream and milk contain calcium, the calorie content of each is vastly different.\nDue to the high energy-density of heavy cream, there is a limit to how much we can consume.\nHeavy cream only contains lower amounts of the milk sugar lactose compared to milk.\nHowever, for those that do suffer with a mild sensitivity to lactose, they may be able to handle heavy cream better than milk.\nOn the other hand, heavy cream is 3% lactose by weight and people generally only consume small amounts of it.\nFirstly, to avoid confusion, there is nothing wrong with food containing high amounts of calories or fat.\nHowever, the issue with heavy cream (and other isolated fats like butter and coconut oil) is that they are energy-dense but not very nutrient-dense.\nHeavy cream is a perfectly healthy dairy food, but it lacks nutritional value compared to whole food sources of fat such as eggs, meat or fish.\nSometimes people may have sensitivities to dairy products, or they may not be able to source heavy cream at a time they need it.\nAlthough it won’t be exactly the same, it is an excellent substitute for heavy cream that is equivalent in taste/fat content.\nA lot of people enjoy heavy cream, but don’t really know what to make with it.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the heavy cream, chicken broth, salt and pepper.\nTo start making the ricotta, first add the whole milk, heavy cream and salt to a pan.\nThere may be a trend for drinking coffee with butter these days, but — to me at least — heavy cream tastes so much better.\nYou can add the cream in its fresh chilled state, but it is better if you heat it up first – a steaming hot coffee is always ideal.\nIf you want something truly indulgent (as a rare treat) then you can also heat a (small) cup of heavy cream and add it to 1 or 2 espresso shots.\nThe latter option tastes unbelievable, but it is extremely high in fat/calories, so it should only be a rare treat.\nWhen the soup starts to boil, reduce the heat and pour the heavy cream into the pan.\nAt this point, add the basil leaves to the soup and then continue simmering for about ten more minutes.\nHeavy cream is a delicious high-fat dairy food, and when you use it in the kitchen, it leads to great things.\nFor more dairy ideas, see this guide to clotted cream – a delicious dairy food with a high butterfat content.",
        "2": "That’s why the choice of whipping cream and heavy cream for some people is really important but some product of heavy cream offers you with more delicious taste because of the higher fat content.\nThere are so much treats that could be harmful for your health but whipped cream, though it is not perfect and high in calories, is still considered to be one of the healthy treats you could consume in daily basis.\nJust like any dairy products, whipped cream is also high in calcium which is great for healthy bones.\nFurthermore, the vitamin K found in whipped cream is also relatively high to help you reducing the risk of some bone problems like osteoporosis and bone fracture.\nNot only that, the combinations of vitamins and minerals in whipped could is also excellent for tooth enamel and gum health.\nFolate found in whipped cream is relatively high that could promote the development of brain cells and nerve systems.\nThough the content of vitamin C in whipped cream is not really high but it is enough to help you protecting your body by enhancing your immunity system.\nFurthermore, whipped cream contains high amount of vitamin A which is effective to counteract any infections by producing the opposite compound to the antigen.\nFolate is excellent compound for brain while vitamin B2 and phosphorus are perfect combination to promote healthy growth and nerve system.\nWhipped cream contains adequate amount of folate but contains excellent amount of vitamin B2 and phosphorus which make it one of the super foods for brain.\nOne of the compounds that are great for hair health is protein and as mentioned in the table above, whipped cream is relatively high in protein, since it is a dairy product.\nIt means that you cannot get the same benefits if you are consuming non-dairy whipped cream.\nIt is a common knowledge that all foods that are rich of vitamin A are excellent for vision and whipped cream contains relatively high amount of vitamin A.\nIron and other minerals are essential to the production of red blood cells and luckily, whipped cream is so rich of certain minerals and vitamins.\nNo matter how much health benefits you could get from consuming whipped cream, but you should well aware of some cautions that is lurking behind the delicious taste of whipped cream.\nFurthermore, in cake that is using butter cream by adding some whipped cream will enhance the taste."

        "0": "Croutons are small baked or sautéed pieces of bread that add savory taste and crunch to a salad, soup, and other dishes.\nHealth experts advise that at least half the grains you consume should be whole grains to help you get more fiber in your diet.\nWhole grain croutons can be hard to find at your local market, but making them at home can help you meet that fiber recommendation.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 0.5 ounces (about 14g) of plain croutons.1 There are almost 58 calories and 10.4 grams of carbohydrates in a single 0.5-ounce serving of plain croutons.\nIf you make whole wheat croutons at home, you're likely to benefit from about 1.4 grams of fiber in a half-cup serving.2 A 0.5-ounce serving of seasoned croutons provides about 66 calories, 2.6 grams of fat, 9g of carbohydrate, 0.7g of fiber, 0.6 g of added sugar, 189mg of sodium, and 1.53g of protein.3 There is no recorded glycemic index (GI) for croutons.\nBut the glycemic index of white bread is 73–77, making it a high glycemic food.\nWhole wheat bread has a slightly lower glycemic index of 72–76, and specialty bread baked with whole grains are much lower at around 51–55.4 Croutons are likely to have a slightly lower GI because any fat used to sauté them can help to slow the food's impact on blood sugar.\nThere is less than a full gram of fat in a serving of croutons, although nutrition facts can vary based on the variety that you choose.\nIf the croutons were made from enriched bread, it is likely that the bread had certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid) and iron added back after processing.\nBut because your crouton serving is likely to be small, you're still not going to consume significant amounts of these nutrients.\nCroutons may be able to provide some limited health benefits, especially if they are made from whole grain bread.\nBut most brands of croutons made from enriched bread are not going to contribute to your health in any substantial way.\nCroutons provide calories (energy) primarily in the form of carbohydrates.\nHealth experts generally advise, however, that we get carbohydrates from nutrient-rich sources like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables because they may also provide vitamins and minerals.5 If you make whole wheat croutons at home, you'll give your body a small boost of fiber.\nCurrent guidelines set forth by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggest that adults under 50 should consume between 25–34 grams of fiber per day depending on age group and sex.5 Fiber can help relieve constipation and improve the regularity of your bowel movements.\nInsoluble fiber (found in whole grains) is sometimes used to treat or prevent constipation and diverticulitis which affects the colon, according to the National Institutes of Health.6 A higher intake of whole grains is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and total cancer.\nIt is also associated with a lower risk for all-cause and disease-specific mortality.7 Even though your whole grain intake from croutons is not likely to be substantial, choosing whole-grain croutons over croutons made from enriched grains on a regular basis may help you take advantage of these health benefits.\nThose who are allergic to wheat should not consume croutons.\nThe law requires that food manufacturers that make products containing allergens such as wheat must include the presence of the allergen, in clear language, on the ingredient label.\nThose with allergies should note that due to COVID-19, the FDA is temporarily allowing food manufacturers to make small ingredient changes to their products without adjusting food labels to help mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nBut these changes do not affect foods containing allergens like wheat.\nFor safety reasons, the FDA states ingredient changes can only be made without adjusting food labels as long as they do not cause adverse health effects in those with food allergies and sensitivities.9﻿﻿﻿﻿ There are some people who may want to exercise caution when choosing whether or not to consume croutons.\nThe gluten or sodium in croutons may cause problems for some individuals with certain health conditions.\nIf you have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, you should not consume croutons made from gluten-containing grains.\nWheat allergy is sometimes confused with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.\nThere are also brands that sell gluten-free bread, so if you enjoy croutons and follow a gluten-free diet, you can make your own croutons at home.\nCroutons can increase the sodium content of certain foods like soups or salads that are already high in sodium.\nCroutons usually contain added salt.\nIn addition, they may contain seasoning blends or other high-sodium ingredients (such as parmesan cheese).\nCurrent dietary guidelines suggest that adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of salt per day.5 The American Heart Association (AHA) agrees, but suggests that an intake of 1,500 mg per day is more ideal, especially for those with high blood pressure.10 If you are sensitive to salt or if you follow a low-salt diet to manage a condition such as hypertension, look for low-sodium croutons.\nOr you can make your own croutons at home using seasonings that don't contain sodium.\nOften, these are larger croutons, made from fresh bread and seasoned with premium herbs and spices.\nSometimes these croutons look more like a small slice of bread than a cube.\nAccording to the USDA, croutons should generally be consumed within 5–6 months after purchase for the best freshness and quality.\nUpdated April 26, 2019.",
        "1": "It also provides around 1.5 grams of dietary fiber, which represents 6 percent of the recommended daily value.\nThe USDA Nutrient Database reveals that croutons have a dietary folate equivalent of 63 micrograms, which makes up approximately 15 percent of the daily recommended intake, which is 400 micrograms.\nThis amount represents 16 percent of the recommended daily value.\nThe amount of sodium present in croutons is 209 milligrams, which is about 9 percent of the daily value.\nIn 30 grams of seasoned croutons, there are 186 calories and 7 grams of fat, which consists of 4.7 grams of unsaturated fat and 2.1 grams of saturated fat.\nAs for vitamins, seasoned croutons provide double the amount of riboflavin, as well as 0.2 milligrams of vitamin E and 3 micrograms of vitamin K.\nBeginning of dialog window.\nEnd of dialog window.",

        "1": "Here are all seven ways cukes (which contain about 20 calories and 4 grams of carb) help protect and improve your health.\nThe top nutrient in cucumbers is vitamin K, which is key for bone health.\nThis nutrient is required for bone formation, and several studies have linked low K levels to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.\nCucumbers contain dozens of antioxidants, including flavonoids, which are known to protect against heart disease.\nAccording to the USDA, one medium cucumber contains 194 grams of fluid.\nAdding sliced cukes to water also adds flavor, which can help boost your water intake even more.\nThey’re low in calories, but contain filling fiber and fluid.\nAnd of the 4 grams of total carb in the cucumber, one and a half are from fiber.\nScooping up hummus with a medium peeled cucumber rather than 10 pita chips saves 100 calories and 15 grams of carbohydrate, and takes up far more space in your stomach.",
        "2": "As you’ll learn below, they’re more than just a way to make pickles or reduce puffiness around your eyes — cucumber nutrition benefits include fighting free radical damage and inflammation.\nCukes are one of the lowest calorie veggies, yet supply powerful polyphenol compounds that can help naturally slow aging caused by oxidative stress.\nAdditionally, known among researchers for their anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering and antioxidant activity, cucumbers have a detoxifying, cleansing effect on the body.\nSeveral bioactive compounds have been isolated from the nutritious cucumber, including cucurbitacins, glucosides, lignans, apigenin and flavonols like fisetin.\nAs such, eating plenty of high-antioxidant foods like cucumbers may help lower your risk of cancer.\n2. High in Nutrients but Low in Calories Cucumbers are one of the vegetables with the highest water content.\nThis means cucumber nutrition offers valuable vitamins and minerals, yet is super low in calories — with only about 16 calories per cup.\nPlus, cucumber nutrition can help quench thirst and prevent the desire to snack due to dehydration.\n3. Helps Detoxify the Body Cucurbitacins are a category of diverse compounds found in the plants of family Cucurbitaceae, including cucumbers.\nIn the process, they’re great for reducing bloating and uncomfortable water retention — one reason to fill up on cucumbers after a night of salty food or alcohol.\n4. Hydrates and Soothes Skin Plan on eating the whole cucumber whenever possible, since the skin and seeds contain important compounds.\nCucumber skin is a good source of vitamin A that can aid in skin health, plus cukes and their skin have diuretic effects that can reduce puffiness.\nAccording to some studies, cucumber slices or seeds applied directly to the skin gives a soothing and cooling effect against skin irritations and reduces swelling and redness.\nThe fruit is considered a “refrigerant, haemostatic and tonic, useful in treating hyperdipsia or thermoplegia.” In other words, cucumbers help stop bleeding, reduce heat buildup associated with inflammation, quench your thirst, relieve dehydration and fight “sunstroke” all at the same time.\nDue to their anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects, cucumbers can help decrease swelling and puffiness around the eyes.\nEven letting cucumber slices sit on your eyes for 20–30 minutes can help.\n6. Helps Improve Metabolic/Heart Health Cucurbitacins found in cucumbers have been researched for their cytotoxic, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular and anti-diabetic effects.\nLignans found in cucumbers have well-documented immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial for fighting cardiovascular disease.\nCucumbers also provide important minerals that help maintain a healthy heart, including potassium and magnesium.\n7. Improves Digestion and Relieves Constipation The seeds of a cucumber are known for having a healing, heat-reducing effect on the body, and they’re often used to prevent and naturally relieve constipation in traditional forms of medicine like Ayurveda.\nMany people suffer from magnesium deficiency without even knowing it, but cucumber nutrition is a source of magnesium and other electrolytes that can help hydrate the gut and digestive lining, which keeps you more “regular.” Since they’re a great vegetable for juicing or making smoothies, you can try combining cucumbers with other hydrating foods — like melon, lime, avocado, celery and fennel — to create a natural anti-bloating drink.\n8. Helps Alkalize the Blood Cucumber nutrition includes being one of the top alkaline foods that help balance the body’s pH level and counteract the effects of an acidic diet.\nSince the body is able to easily digest nutrients in liquid form, this is one reason why cucumbers are a popular ingredient in green alkalizing juices.\n9. Supports Strong Bones With 22 percent of your daily vitamin K in every cup of cucumbers, eating more cukes is a good way to help maintain bone mineral density.\nHelps Prevent or Treat Headaches Traditionally, cucumbers have been used as a natural headache remedy and somewhat of a pain reducer since they fight inflammation and swelling.\nMany studies show that foods high in water and magnesium like cucumbers combat headaches by balancing fluids in the body and preventing dehydration.\nThe juice from cucumbers has long been used as a natural electrolyte booster before energy drinks like vitamin water existed.\nSince it has antibacterial properties and is an anti-inflammatory food, the cucumber has been used as a home remedy for acne or to reduce redness and puffiness on the skin.\nCucumber and zucchini are in the same plant family and have a similar appearance, but the two are different in terms of texture and nutritional value.\nBoth spinach and cucumbers are low in carbs and great vegetables to have if you’re eating a low-carb diet.\nHowever, unlike cucumbers, which are typically eaten raw or fermented, sautéing, boiling or cooking spinach for just one minute can improve its nutrient absorbability and bring out its taste.\nFermentation is what gives the cucumber its distinctively tangy, sour and salty flavor once it’s made into a pickle, plus it contains live microorganisms that have beneficial effects.\nIs it good to eat cucumber every day?\nDue to their diuretic effects, should you not eat cucumber at night?"

        "0": "While climate change may affect waterfowl directly (e.g., by altering timing of migration), more serious impacts could occur through effects on habitat.\nProjections for the next 100 years indicate warming in most areas, changing patterns of precipitation, accelerating sea-level rise, declining snowpacks, and increasing frequency and intensity of severe weather.\nConsequences for waterfowl habitat could include changes in the timing and duration of when wetlands are wet, changes in land use, northward expansion of invasive species, and greater challenges for water management.\nNext in importance are the continent's key waterfowl wintering areas: the Central Valley of California, Gulf Coast, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley.\nIn the Prairie Pothole Region, for example, average temperatures have increased over the past century, and all global climate models predict further warming and a reduction in average soil moisture in this region.\nAgricultural practices such as grazing and haying that leave grassland intact provide habitat for nesting waterfowl and other wildlife, and conserve accumulated carbon in prairie soils.\nAgricultural experts are divided about how prairie agriculture will change in the decades ahead, but one recent analysis by Agriculture Canada suggests that new areas of Alberta and Saskatchewan may become suitable for small-grain production in the future, which would be a negative development for waterfowl habitat.\nThe biggest obstacle in predicting impacts of climate change on boreal waterfowl is our meager understanding of the basic ecology of boreal wetlands.\nThis is a serious knowledge gap because while several boreal duck species (scaup, scoters, and wigeon) are declining, resource development is expanding and northern climate is changing.\nLess sediment is available to build new wetland habitat, so coastal marshes are unable to keep pace with sea-level rise.\nRefuges, duck clubs, state wetlands, and rice fields all depend on allocations of California's managed water.\nIf rice production declines (because of rising irrigation costs, for example), then winter flooding of agricultural land would be of little value to waterfowl.\nFuture impacts of climate change are less certain in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.\nPresently, however, climate models offer contrasting predictions about future river flows, leaving us with little ability to predict flooding patterns.\nGlobal climate change poses difficult challenges for conservation planners because of the scale and complexity of the problem, the long time required to learn about impacts, and the uncertainty associated with predictions about future conditions.\nIn the long run, reducing greenhouse gas emissions seems prudent for reducing losses of waterfowl habitat, and DU is taking steps to assess and improve its own carbon \"balance sheet.\" We must also consider strategies to help species and ecosystems cope with changes that are inevitable.\nWaterfowl habitats almost everywhere have been affected by human development, so any effects of climate change will be imposed on top of existing pressures.\nReducing existing stresses on wetlands (e.g., nutrient loading, toxic chemicals, filling, drainage, soil erosion, urban encroachment) and associated uplands (e.g., overgrazing, intensive tillage) should reduce vulnerability to climate-induced changes and may be the single most achievable thing that we can do today to help prepare for a warmer but uncertain future.\nRestoring or protecting complexes of wetlands of varying permanence and striving to restore habitats across a wide geographic area may help hedge against variable moisture conditions.\nFor instance, coordinated planning for the provision of wintering habitat in the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast regions seems prudent and is under way by conservation partners in these regions.\nDU will also support efforts by the national wildlife refuge system and by neighboring states and provinces to cope with species' range shifts and changes to waterfowl habitat.\nIn this way, efforts to restore rivers and floodplain habitats in the Midwest can benefit coastal wetlands by restoring historic river flooding and sedimentation downstream.\nThe public may support added wetland restoration efforts where multiple benefits of nutrient reduction in water, flood abatement, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat can be realized simultaneously.\nAt the state/provincial, federal, and international levels, DU's science is already informing public policy discussions that seek to protect the ability of grasslands, wetlands, and other natural systems to absorb and store carbon, and that support market-based tools for conservation of environmental goods and services.\nOne specific challenge for waterfowl and wetland managers is that climate models were built to work at large geographic scales.\nIn Louisiana, water-management plans that better resemble historical processes that rebuild Mississippi Delta wetlands are needed.\nThey will be good for wetland conservation and inform future management choices whatever the extent of climate change.",

        "0": "Most cooking methods involve preparing the duck so that the majority of the fat is rendered off, leaving crispy skin and lean meat.\nThe rendered duck fat can be used as a healthier alternative to butter or other animal fats used in cooking.\nIt's an excellent source of protein and healthy fat as well as micronutrients including selenium, iron, and niacin.\nDuck eggs are also nutrient dense with a similar nutrient profile to chicken eggs (with higher amounts per egg because duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs.) This nutrition information, for one 3-ounce (85g) roasted skinless Pekin duck breast, is provided by the USDA.1﻿ The Pekin breed is the most commonly consumed type of duck in the U.S. Duck alone does not contain any carbohydrates (which means it does not have any fiber or sugar).\nHowever, the amount of overall fat content will vary significantly based on whether or not duck is cooked and consumed with or without the skin.\nIn fact, without skin and visible fat, duck meat has less fat than roasted skinless chicken breasts.\nFor example, skinless duck breast provides only 2g total fat (0.5g of which is saturated fat) per 3-ounce portion.\nThe same portion of roasted skinless chicken breast provides 3g total fat (1g of which is saturated fat).\nAs with chicken, duck legs and thighs have slightly more total fat (a 3-ounce portion of skinless duck legs contains 5g total fat), but duck legs still contain less fat than skinless chicken thighs.2﻿ Moreover, the majority of the fat is healthy unsaturated fat, including a high amount of monounsaturated fat and a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.\nEven if consumed with skin, the fat content of duck will vary depending on how much fat was rendered off during the cooking process.\nDuck meat provides high-quality protein with a variety of non-essential and essential amino acids.\nDuck is an animal protein that provides some of the beneficial nutrients common in red meat (such as iron), without as much saturated fat as red meat.\nConsuming an adequate amount of selenium is also important for thyroid health.3﻿ A 3-ounce portion of Pekin duck meat provides over 50% of the daily value for selenium.\nSome research shows that consuming animal protein, including duck, may improve bone density and strength—as long as calcium intake is also sufficient.4﻿ While oily fish is considered a top source of omega-3 fatty acids, duck also contains these heart-healthy acids.\nEating duck (and other forms of poultry) in place of steak and other meats high in saturated fat also has the potential for some positive health outcomes related to the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nPlus, duck provides about as much iron as red meat, significantly more than you get from chicken.\nThis is so residues can exit the bird's system.\"5﻿ While many chefs prefer to serve duck medium-rare, the USDA recommends cooking duck to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, as you would with any poultry.5﻿ If you render duck fat, strain it through a cheesecloth to filter out any particles that may have come off of the meat.\nTo prepare duck breasts, start by rendering the fat and crisping up the skin.\nDuck, young duckling, domesticated, White Pekin, breast, meat only, boneless, cooked without skin, broiled.\nDuck, young duckling, domesticated, White Pekin, leg, meat only, bone in, cooked without skin, braised.\ndoi:10.1002/jbmr.194 US Department of Agriculture.",
        "1": "There are other sources in different regions of the world, but these two represent the most common breeds that are butchered for duck meat.\nOne of the biggest advantages of eating duck is all the nutrients that come from the meat.\nDuck has proven to be an excellent source of iron, which is essential in the production of hemoglobin, a base part of red blood cells.\nMany proteins that play important roles in keeping your body running are also found in duck meat.\nDuck meat is a great source of a number of vitamin B compounds, especially B-12.\nFinally, duck meat is a source of glycine.\nThe biggest knock many people have against duck meat is the elevated fat content.\nIndeed, duck has been found to have particularly high levels of saturated fat, especially in comparison to other poultry dishes.\nIf you remove the skin before cooking it, duck actually has about the same fat content as meat from other birds.\nBecause of these concerns, many nutritionists often recommend treating duck as a dish for special occasions and not as a full-time substitute for other healthier meats.\nWhen you’re preparing a meal made with duck meat, it’s important to be sure the meat is cooked all the way through before consuming it, just as with other meat that comes from birds.\nMany popular dishes throughout the world make use of duck meat.\nOriginally found in China during the Ming Dynasty, Peking duck is a specialty dish renowned the world over.\nAnother popular meal made with duck meat is foie gras.\nDuck fat also comes with many nutrition facts and health benefits.\nTo produce duck fat, you simply have to collect the fat that renders while you’re cooking the meat.\nThough there are disagreements about the specific health benefits of using duck fat in your cooking, some nutritionists believe it can help reduce “bad” cholesterol, increase energy levels, and lower blood glucose levels.\nThere are many places to find the duck meat that will make your next meal special.",
        "2": "This article examines the nutrition profile, benefits, and potential negatives of duck meat.\nHowever, nations around the world consume a wide range of roasted and steamed duck dishes.\nGenerally, duck meat has a higher fat content than other poultry such as chicken and turkey, and the meat is darker in color.\nDuck meat has a much stronger flavor than both chicken and turkey.\nThe following data tables show the full nutritional values for duck meat per 100 grams (4).\nAs shown in the table, duck offers a moderate amount of protein and a relatively higher fat content compared to other meats.\nSelenium is the most concentrated mineral in duck, and the meat is high in phosphorus, iron, zinc, and copper.\nMost of the health benefits of duck meat relate to the protein and nutrients it contains.\nGlycine is an important amino acid that plays a wide range of roles within the body, and duck offers 1614 mg per 100 grams (4).\nPer 100 grams, duck (including the skin) offers 19 grams of protein.\nHowever, just the pure duck meat without skin provides an even more significant amount, supplying 23.5 grams per 100 g (12).\nThe primary mineral in duck meat is selenium, and this mineral offers a lot nutritionally.\nDuck provides 29% of the RDI for selenium per 100 grams.\nWhile duck is a healthy food that contains a variety of health-promoting compounds, there is one potential drawback to be aware of; contamination.\nHowever, one study found that duck species living in aquatic systems near to areas of environmental pollution showed excessively high levels of mercury and selenium.\nAs a result, tests on duck meat regularly find mercury contamination levels that can exceed the amounts in high-mercury seafood (22).\nSince many people are unsure how to cook duck, here are two delicious recipe ideas; one for roasting and one for steaming.\nDuck is a nutritious meat that offers several beneficial nutrients and a great taste."

        "2": "This veggie is especially loved for its bright purple color, fleshy skin, uniquely bitter-yet-pleasant taste — and of course the widespread benefits of eggplant nutrition.\nIt is a vegetable with a lot to offer: a high amount of antioxidants, special phytonutrients, including phenolic compounds, flavonoids, such as nasunin, and numerous vitamins and minerals too.\nAnd all of these eggplant nutrition benefits come at a low calorie count of only 35 calories per cup, thanks to its high fiber and water content.\nEggplant, a member of the nightshade and Solanaceae plant family, is considered by researchers to be a part of a group of valuable crops due to their anthocyanin antioxidant compounds, which can be seen in its rich purple colors.\nIt contains a somewhat rare and extremely beneficial type of antioxidant known as nasunin.\nNasunin is a type of anthocyanin antioxidant found in all types of eggplant varieties, in addition to other deeply colored fruits and vegetables.\nNasunin is one of the key contributors to the health benefits of eggplant nutrition.\nMost of the nasunin present within this veggie/fruit is found in its purple skin, so consuming the entire vegetable, including its peel, is important to reap all the health benefits.\nToday there are seven main types that are harvested and made available throughout most “Western” countries, including the most popular types, the Italian (large, purple oval) and small Japanese eggplant.\nThe health benefits of eggplant nutrition seem to be consistent across the different types, with the exception of the variety known as “black magic” eggplant.\nSome sources have found that black magic eggplants can have up to three times the amount of antioxidant phenolics as the other types, although more research is needed to confirm the exact differences.\nAs mentioned above, one of the most studied eggplant health benefits is this veggie’s rich source of antioxidants.\nNasunin is one antioxidant involved in the ability to help cells receive and use nutrients from food and to discard of waste.\nWithout enough antioxidants like nasunin present within the body, toxins and waste build up and can lead to a host of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis and more.\nEggplant nutrition contains disease-fighting nasunin, as previously mentioned, in addition to many other phytonutrients, like chlorogenic acid.\nChlorogenic acid is type of polyphenol that has been linked with benefits such as regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.\nStudies show that eggplant has anti-hypertensive effects and can be beneficial for heart health due to its ability to fight inflammation and oxidative stress.\nEggplant nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining healthy normal cholesterol levels because of its phytonutrients’ ability to improve circulation and reduce plaque buildup in the main arteries, including the aorta.\nAccording to research done by the Royal Society of Chemistry, some studies show that eggplants containing potent cardio-protective compounds judging by their ability to increase left ventricular function (one of the main blood-pumping chambers of the heart) and reduce apoptosis.\nConsuming vegetables that have a high content of water, fiber and nutrients helps flush out waste and toxins from the digestive tract.\nBecause of the known benefits of eggplant nutrition, this veggie/fruit is included in the GAPS diet.\nLike other fruits/vegetables, it’s a source of mostly carbohydrates, but it also contains fiber — which means it can help make you feel full, so you are less likely to overeat.\nEggplant nutrition provides a good source of vitamin B1 and vitamin B6, two of the vitamins that are included in the healthy metabolism and energy-promoting B vitamin complex.\nB vitamins are water-soluble, found in many vegetables and other whole food sources, and are needed to maintain healthy energy levels, brain function, metabolism, heart health and focus.\nVitamin B1, meanwhile, is used for maintain a healthy metabolism, blood and heart health, brain function, and more.\nThe leaves are edible but not very flavorful, plus they contain compounds called solanine, which when consumed in very high amounts (which is unlikely) may cause some health issues.\nIt’s fine to eat raw eggplant, although cooking it enhances its nutrient availability, texture and taste.\nCooked eggplant, which is normally the type that most people eat as opposed to raw, has been shown in studies to have even more benefits.\nCooking it results in even more available antioxidant content and biological activity of beneficial properties, as the thermal effect further releases disease-fighting compounds.\nOther nightshade vegetables include tomatoes, bell peppers and various types of potatoes.\nNightshade vegetables are known for causing digestive disturbances in some people.\nNightshade vegetables are high in oxalic acid, which has been correlated with an increased risk for forming kidney stones and arthritis in some people.\nSome people report feeling better after removing nightshade vegetables from their diets, suffering from less digestive distress and other inflammatory symptoms, including arthritis.\nWhat studies have shown is that eggplant does tend to be a common allergen for some people, and all types seem to have the same negative effects in those who react to negatively to this veggie/fruit due to allergies.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and

        "1": "The Lantern has good news for those of you who, like her, are devotees of the 24-hour breakfast menu: According to the best data we have so far, eggs are on the green end of the animal-protein spectrum.\nWith regards to energy use, pork had the highest numbers and milk the lowest, with chicken and eggs ranked somewhere in the middle.\n(The report also looked at  eutrophication—a kind of water pollution caused by excess nutrients—and  acidification, but found conflicting data in these categories.) Since the majority of the impacts associated with chicken-rearing come from producing their feed, one way to look at the question is as a matter of efficiency: Which type of bird does the best job turning the food it eats into the eggs we eat?\nData from Europe indicate that chickens raised in conventional cage systems—the much-maligned “battery” cages now being phased out in the European Union—are the most efficient layers: It takes them about 2 kilograms of feed to produce 1 kilogram of eggs.\nChickens raised in cage-free or barn systems—in which the birds are free to roam around the building but don’t necessarily have access to the outdoors—require about 14 percent more food.\nOrganic chickens, whose feed is grown without chemical fertilizers or pesticides, need roughly 20 percent more food than birds kept in cages.\n(For assistance decoding the dizzying variety of egg labels out there, see this  helpful guide from the New York Times.) The differences in feed efficiency arise in part because cage systems allow farmers to carefully calibrate the birds’ temperature, so the animals expend less energy keeping themselves warm.\nFinally, in noncage systems, it’s harder to regulate ammonia emissions from chicken poop—a major issue of environmental concern on poultry farms.\n(Keep in mind that “free-range” doesn’t always mean that the hen spent its days frolicking in sun-kissed fields; it could mean the bird had some access to a concrete lot.) In addition, organic eggs may come with benefits that aren’t necessarily reflected when you judge by efficiency alone—like a reduction in pesticide and fertilizer applications, which is good for soil and water quality.\nWell, besides the happy, satisfied glow that comes from knowing where your food is produced, buying from a  well-managed small farm can have eco-benefits.\nBirds that are “pasture raised”—i.e., that eat a lot of insects and grass alongside regular feed— produce eggs that may have health benefits, like  higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.\nBut for her personal grocery needs, the Lantern likes going small and local when she can.",

        "2": "Although eggs are high in cholesterol, eating them has very little effect on blood cholesterol levels in most people.\nOne large egg (50 grams) has approximately 6.5 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, 0.5 gram of carbohydrate, and 70 calories.\nAdditionally, eggs are high in choline, an essential nutrient which has been linked to liver and brain health.\nEgg yolks also contain nutrients called carotenoids which may help protect eye health in some people.\nEggs are a convenient and delicious way to help meet your daily protein needs.\nThree large eggs provide about 19 grams of high-quality protein.\nOf course, the larger the egg, the more protein and nutrients it contains, too.\nRegardless of their size or the way they’re prepared, eggs are a nutritious food you can enjoy regularly  — two, three, or more at a time — without keeping track of their calories.\nIn study after study, eggs have been shown to help people stay full for several hours after eating.\nEating foods high in protein like eggs can trigger the release of “fullness hormones” like GLP-1 and PYY.\nSo it makes sense that eating nourishing, filling foods like eggs that naturally reduce hunger could help you lose weight over time.\nAlso, limited research suggests that including eggs in a higher-protein diet may encourage fat loss and help preserve muscle.\nDecades ago, eggs earned a reputation for increasing heart disease risk because they’re high in cholesterol.\nHowever, according to recent high-quality research, the opposite seems to be true: eating eggs may improve several markers of heart health.\nFrequent egg consumption has been shown to increase levels of HDL cholesterol (a marker linked to decreased heart disease risk) in healthy individuals and in those who are overweight or have diabetes.\nFor example, in studies of people following low-carb diets, those who ate whole eggs experienced greater insulin sensitivity and beneficial increases in HDL and LDL particle size compared to those who consumed a yolk-free egg substitute.\nIn addition, consuming whole eggs may improve HDL’s ability to remove cholesterol from blood vessel walls in some people.\nFinally, contrary to previous thought, eating eggs several times a week seems to be perfectly safe for people who have heart disease or for those at increased risk of developing it.\nOf course, what you eat and drink with the eggs — and what you consume at other meals — can also affect heart health.\nIt’s true that eggs are higher in cholesterol than most foods.\nHowever, eating eggs generally doesn’t lead to higher levels of blood cholesterol.\nIn most people, eating more eggs prompts the body to produce less cholesterol, resulting in stable levels in the blood.\nIn studies of healthy adults, overweight individuals, and those with type 2 diabetes, most people’s LDL cholesterol levels increased only slightly in response to eating more eggs.\nMany people are surprised to learn that eggs do not worsen the risk of heart disease, metabolic disease, or type 2 diabetes.\nEggs are one of the best examples of the complicated relationship between lower-quality scientific studies and media reports.\nThe vast majority of observational studies show that people who eat more eggs are less healthy at baseline, eat a lower-quality baseline diet, eat more calories, exercise less, and even smoke more cigarettes.\nStill other observational studies show just the opposite: that eating eggs is not associated with an increased risk of health complications, and in some cases may be linked to a decreased risk.\nUsing higher-quality evidence makes it clear that there is no scientific basis to fear eating eggs.\nIf properly refrigerated, eggs are unlikely to spoil, but their quality will diminish over time.\nStore eggs in their original carton on a shelf inside the refrigerator, away from any foods with odors.\nBoil these eggs and eat them within a few days.\nAlthough some eggs may be contaminated with salmonella, cooking them until both the yolk and white are firm will kill the bacteria.\nThe risk of bacterial contamination is relatively low in properly refrigerated eggs.\nHowever, eating raw or undercooked eggs is a common cause of food poisoning.\nCooking eggs makes their protein easier to digest.\nIn addition, raw egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which hinders your body’s absorption of biotin (vitamin B7).\nBut eating eggs doesn’t increase the risk of heart disease.\nOn the contrary, when included in a healthy diet, eggs may be beneficial for heart disease risk factors.\nEat whole eggs to get their maximum health benefits, flavor, and satisfaction."

have shown that the ALA in flax seeds prevented cholesterol from being deposited in the blood vessels of the heart, reduced inflammation in the arteries and reduced tumor growth (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\nA Costa Rican study involving 3,638 people found that those who ate more ALA had a lower risk of heart attack than those who consumed less ALA (6Trusted Source).\nAlso, a large review of 27 studies involving more than 250,000 people found that ALA was linked to a 14% lower risk of heart disease (7Trusted Source).\nPlant-based ALA fatty acids are proven to have heart health benefits and are linked to a lower risk of stroke.\nLignans are plant compounds that have antioxidant and estrogen properties, both of which can help lower the risk of cancer and improve health (12Trusted Source).\nInterestingly, flax seeds contain up to 800 times more lignans than other plant foods (5Trusted Source).\nObservational studies show that those who eat flax seeds have a lower risk of breast cancer, particularly postmenopausal women (13Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, according to a Canadian study involving more than 6,000 women, those who eat flax seeds are 18% less likely to develop breast cancer (14Trusted Source).\nIn a small study including 15 men, those given 30 grams of flax seeds a day while following a low-fat diet showed reduced levels of a prostate cancer marker, suggesting a lower risk of prostate cancer (15Trusted Source).\nJust one tablespoon of flax seeds contains 3 grams of fiber, which is 8–12% of the daily recommended intake for men and women, respectively (17Trusted Source).\nThis has been shown to help regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol (18Trusted Source).\nWith so much fiber packed in each tiny seed, adding flax seeds to your diet promotes regular bowel movements and can improve your digestive health.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Another health benefit of flax seeds is their ability to lower cholesterol levels.\nIn one study in people with high cholesterol, consuming 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of flaxseed powder daily for three months lowered total cholesterol by 17% and “bad” LDL cholesterol by almost 20% (19Trusted Source).\nAnother study of people with diabetes found that taking 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of flaxseed powder daily for one month resulted in a 12% increase in “good” HDL cholesterol (20Trusted Source).\nIn postmenopausal women, consuming 30 grams of flax seeds daily lowered total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by approximately 7% and 10%, respectively (21Trusted Source).\nThis process lowers your blood levels of cholesterol (18Trusted Source).\nThe high fiber content of flax seeds can help lower cholesterol and may play an important role in improving heart health.\nStudies on flax seeds have also focused on its natural ability to lower blood pressure (22Trusted Source).\nA Canadian study found eating 30 grams of flax seeds daily for six months lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg and 7 mmHg, respectively (23Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, according to a large review that looked at data from 11 studies, taking flax seeds daily for more than three months lowered blood pressure by 2 mmHg (24Trusted Source).\nWhile that might seem insignificant, a 2-mmHg reduction in blood pressure can lower the risk of dying from stroke by 10% and from heart disease by 7% (25Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds are a great source of plant-based protein, and there’s growing interest in flaxseed protein and its health benefits.\nNumerous lab and animal studies have shown that flaxseed protein helped improve immune function, lowered cholesterol, prevented tumors and had anti-fungal properties (28Trusted Source, 29, 30Trusted Source).\nA few studies have found that people with type 2 diabetes who added 10–20 grams of flaxseed powder to their daily diet for at least one month saw reductions of 8–20% in blood sugar levels (20Trusted Source, 32, 33).\nThis blood sugar-lowering effect is notably due to flax seeds’ insoluble fiber content.\nHowever, one study found no change in blood sugar levels or any improvement in diabetes management (35Trusted Source).\nFlaxseed oil lacks fiber, which is credited with flax seeds’ ability to lower blood sugar.\nFlax seeds may lower blood sugar due to their insoluble fiber content.\nOne study found that adding 2.5 grams of ground flax fiber extract to a beverage reduced feelings of hunger and overall appetite (36Trusted Source).\nThe resurgence of the use of flaxseed oil is due to its nutritional properties and health benefits.\nThe health benefits noted in the studies above were observed with just 1 tablespoon (10 grams) of ground flax seeds per day.\nThough tiny, they are rich in the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, lignans and fiber, all of which have been shown to have many potential health benefits.\nThey can be used to improve digestive health, lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of cancer and may benefit people with diabetes.",
        "1": "In fact, its Latin name, Linum usitatissimum, means “very useful.” Today, flaxseed is an important addition to many diets, offering health benefits for everything from heart health to blood sugar levels.\nThe vitamins, minerals, and fiber in flaxseed can provide important health benefits.\nFlaxseed has been shown to improve heart health in a number of different ways.\nFlaxseed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help lower your risk of heart attacks.\nFlaxseed has both insoluble and soluble forms of dietary fiber, which can improve your digestive system in several ways.\nSupplementing your diet with flaxseed may also help you manage your blood sugar more effectively.\nThe same small study on the cholesterol-lowering effects of flaxseed also found that people with diabetes who add flaxseed to their diet see a decrease of nearly 20% in their fasting glucose.\nWhile flaxseed is not a substitute for other forms of blood sugar management, it may help people living with diabetes better control their glucose levels.\nMost studies show that eating just 30 grams of flaxseed per day is enough to see health benefits.\nEating one or two servings of flaxseed per day may help you improve your health without consuming too many calories.",
        "2": "This is due to their high content of heart-healthy omega-3 fats, fiber, and other unique plant compounds (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds have been linked to health benefits, such as improved digestion and a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.\nConsuming flax seeds can help promote regularity, prevent constipation, and reduce your risk of diabetes (2Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nStill, flax seeds are high in the amino acids arginine and glutamine — both of which are important for heart and immune system health (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nEating the seeds whole provides the least amount of ALA, as the oil is locked up inside the fibrous structure of the seed (16Trusted Source).\nDue to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids, flax seeds have a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 than many other oil seeds.\nA lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to a lower risk of various chronic diseases (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nThey’re also rich in fat and one of the best plant-based sources of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nThey have been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome, as they reduce levels of fat and glucose in your blood.\nFlax lignans also help reduce blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation in your arteries (31Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds are high in several plant compounds, including p-Coumaric acid, ferulic acid, cyanogenic glycosides, phytosterols, and lignans.\nThe analysis also showed that weight loss tended to be greater in studies lasting for more than 12 weeks and among those who consumed more than 30 grams of flax seeds per day (35Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds contain soluble fiber, which may promote weight loss by reducing hunger and decreasing cravings.\nFlax seeds have been associated with major benefits for heart health, mainly attributed to their content of omega-3 fatty acids, lignans, and fiber.\nHuman studies note that daily consumption of flax seeds — or flaxseed oil — may lower cholesterol by 6–11%.\nThis is supported by animal studies showing that flax seeds may improve cholesterol levels and the composition of blood fats (40Trusted Source, 41, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).\nOne 12-month study found that flax seeds caused an additional 8.5% reduction in LDL (bad) cholesterol, compared to a control group (45Trusted Source).\nThis cholesterol-lowering effect is thought to be caused by the high fiber and lignan content in flax seeds.\nThis reduces cholesterol levels in your body (46Trusted Source).\nThey may have benefits for various aspects of heart health, including blood platelet function, inflammation, and blood pressure.\nThey have been shown to decrease heart disease risk in animal studies by reducing inflammation in the arteries (47Trusted Source).\nSeveral studies link ALA with a lower risk of stroke, heart attacks, and chronic kidney disease.\nThose receiving the supplement had significantly lower rates of death and heart attacks than people in the control group (52Trusted Source).\nPlant-based ALA fatty acids seem to benefit heart health similarly to fish oils, which are rich in EPA and DHA (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55).\nEating flax seeds is an effective way to lower blood pressure (31Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source).\nIn a 6-month study in people with elevated blood pressure, those consuming 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of flax seeds daily experienced a 10 and 7 mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.\nPeople with a systolic level — the top number in a blood pressure reading — greater than 140 mm Hg at the start of the study observed an even greater reduction of 15 mm Hg (56Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds may help fight heart disease by lowering blood pressure, regulating blood cholesterol, and increasing your levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nThe insoluble fiber content in flax seeds adds bulk to your digestive waste, acting as a laxative and relieving constipation (32Trusted Source, 67).\nStudies in people with type 2 diabetes show that supplementing with 10–20 grams of flaxseed powder per day for 1–2 months may reduce fasting blood sugar by up to 19.7% (69Trusted Source, 70).\nHowever, not all studies find flax seeds to be effective in regulating blood glucose and insulin levels (71Trusted Source).\nThough the link between flax seeds and type 2 diabetes is still unclear, they may be considered a safe and healthy addition to your diet if you have type 2 diabetes (72Trusted Source).\nFlax seeds may modestly lower serum levels of sex hormones in overweight women, potentially decreasing breast cancer risk (78Trusted Source, 79Trusted Source).\nThey may also reduce fasting blood sugar in people with diabetes and lower your risk of several cancers.\nHowever, those with thyroid problems should consider avoiding high amounts of flax seeds (84Trusted Source).\nThough the safe upper limit of flaxseed intake has not been determined, one study concluded that 5 tablespoons (50 grams) per day is safe and beneficial for most healthy people (14Trusted Source).\nFor people who are not used to eating a lot of fiber, incorporating flax seeds too quickly can cause mild digestive problems.\nThough human studies are limited, many health professionals fear that consuming flax seeds during pregnancy may have undesirable effects.\nAnimal studies show that flax seeds and flaxseed lignans may cause lower birth weight and affect the development of the offspring’s reproductive system — especially if consumed during early pregnancy (86Trusted Source, 87Trusted Source).\nLarge doses of omega-3 fatty acids may have blood-thinning effects (88Trusted Source).\nThey contain plant compounds that may adversely affect some people and are not considered safe for high-dose consumption in early pregnancy.\nFlax seeds have become popular due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and other plant compounds, which are responsible for many of the seeds’ benefits.\nThey may aid weight loss and improve blood sugar control, as well as heart and digestive health.\nFlax seeds are packed with beneficial nutrients, omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.\nThis article explores 6 potential health benefits of flaxseed oil, plus how to use it."

        "1": "Fiber is an important part of the diet because it prevents constipation, helps control blood sugar levels, protects against heart disease and even helps in weight loss.\nIt also contains more iron, calcium, protein and other nutrients than many other types of flour, and is a source of beta-glucans and other beneficial substances.\n[4] Wheat bran is very rich in insoluble fiber, which has beneficial effects on the human body.\n[2] [4] Use of wheat flour – most often used for the production of bread, pasta, pastries, cakes and biscuits.\nIn combination with the high content of fiber that spelt flour can be proud of, it helps to slow down digestion and induces a feeling of satiety.\nIn addition, high fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nThe fiber content of spelt flour is in fact slightly lower than that of wheat flour, but they contain a similar amount of soluble fiber.\n[5] [6] [7] Since spelt generally contains high levels of minerals and vitamins, it can, for example, improve the immune system, lower blood sugar levels, as well as help with bad LDL cholesterol levels.\n[5] [6] [7] Use of spelt flour – just like wheat flour, it is most often used for the production of bread, pasta, pastries, cakes and biscuits or pancakes.\n[9] [10] Rye flour can improve several aspects of heart health, as some research links its intake to lower risk factors for heart disease.\nFor example, an 8-week study compared the effects of eating rye and wheat flour on blood cholesterol levels.\n[11] The researchers found that rye flour was 14% more effective than wheat flour in reducing bad LDL cholesterol.\n[9] [10] As rye flour is rich in fiber, it effectively contributes to the improvement of the digestive tract, as it absorbs water, and thus helps to improve the permeability of the intestines.\nSome studies even suggest that rye flour was more effective in treating constipation than wheat flour.\nOther studies have also found that fiber from rye flour can increase the level of short-chain fatty acids.\nThese acids have been linked to various benefits, including weight loss, lower blood sugar and protection against colon cancer.\n[9] [10] [11] Use of rye flour – most often used for bread production or yeasting.\nIt is similar to wheat flour, except that it is gluten-free and has a higher protein content than other common flours.\n[12] Oats generally contain large amounts of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that forms a coarse, gel solution in the intestine, causing a feeling of satiety.\nThe main health benefits of beta-glucans include: Oats, and therefore oat flour, are high in antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds called polyphenols.\n[12] [14] [15] Use of oat flour – can be used to prepare all gluten-free dishes – cakes, biscuits, pancakes, etc.\nCoconut flour has a relatively high content of protein, fiber and fat and a relatively low content of carbohydrates compared to other flours.\n[16] Coconut flour can help with weight loss, as it contains medium chain triglycerides (MCT).\nIn fact, studies have linked buckwheat intake to lower blood sugar levels in people with the disease.\n[20] [21] Buckwheat flour boasts with many compounds that are beneficial to heart health, such as rutin, magnesium, copper, fiber and certain proteins.\nAmong cereals and pseudocereals, buckwheat is the richest source of rutin, an antioxidant that can, for example, reduce the risk of heart disease by preventing the formation of blood clots and lowering inflammation or blood pressure.\n[20] [22] [23] Use of buckwheat flour – can be used for baking and cooking or thickening food.\n[24] Rice flour contains choline, which helps transport cholesterol and triglycerides from the liver to places where the body lacks it.\n[26] [27] Green bananas are known to be rich in prebiotic fiber, which is important for promoting intestinal health as well as reducing belly fat.\nPrebiotic fiber also improves digestion and is abundant in banana flour.\n[26] [27] Banana flour is extremely rich in resistant starch, so it can help diabetics improve insulin sensitivity and maintain blood sugar levels.\n[28] [29] [30] Use of tapioca flour – used mainly for thickening food.\nAlmond flour is extremely rich in healthy fats, proteins and vitamin E, which acts as an antioxidant.\n[31] [32] Foods made from wheat are high in carbohydrates, low in fat and fiber.\nAlmond flour, on the other hand, is low in carbohydrates but high in healthy fats and fiber.\nIn addition, almond flour is also rich in magnesium, which is involved in improving blood sugar control, reducing insulin resistance and blood pressure.\n[31] [33] An analysis of five studies found that those who ate almond flour meals had a decrease in LDL cholesterol of 5.79 mg compared to those who ate wheat flour meals.\n[31] [34] [35] Use of almond flour – most often used as a substitute for wheat flour in baking cakes, pancakes and desserts.\nAs a result, flaxseed flour is also a source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which our body cannot make, so we must intake it from the diet.\n–

Griffith Hughes, who described specimens from Barbados in The Natural History of Barbados.[1][9][10] However, Hughes's forbidden fruit may have been a plant distinct from grapefruit although still closely related to it.[citation needed] In 1814, naturalist John Lunan published the term grapefruit to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant.[7] Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (Vitis vinifera).[11] An alternative explanation offered by Tussac (1824) is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes.[12] After this, authors of the period used both terms forbidden fruit and grapefruit as synonyms.[citation needed] In 1830, the Jamaican version of the plant was given the botanical name Citrus paradisi by botanist James Macfadyen.[13] Macfadyen identified two varieties – one called forbidden fruit, the other called Barbadoes Grape Fruit.\nLater, Kim (1990) found a different citrus called forbidden fruit or shaddette in Saint Lucia that is closely related to grapefruits and may be the plant described by Hughes and Macfadyen.[citation needed] The name grape-fruit was used more and more during the 19th century to refer to pomelos, to the consternation of some.[14] The grapefruit was brought to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor.[1] Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984).[citation needed] Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s.\nIts improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.[21] The 'Star Ruby' is the darkest of the red varieties.[1] Developed from an irradiated 'Hudson' grapefruit ('Hudson' being a limb sport of 'Foster', itself a limb sport of the 'Walters'),[22] it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.[23][24] In 2019, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.3 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the world total.\nSecondary producers were Vietnam, the United States, and Mexico.[25] Grapefruits are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies such as A.\nThis parasitism has led to millions in economic costs for nations in Central America and southern North America.[27] Grapefruit varieties are differentiated by the flesh color of fruit they produce.\nCommon varieties are yellow and pink pulp colors.\nFlavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart, resulting from composition of sugars (mainly sucrose), organic acids (mainly citric acid), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes providing aromas.[28] Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the aroma compounds influencing taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.[29] Grapefruit and grapefruit juice have been found to interact with numerous drugs and in many cases, to result in adverse direct and/or side effects (if dosage is not carefully adjusted.)[30] This happens in two very different ways.",

        "1": "Because it is low in calories and a good source of fiber and vitamin C, grapefruit can be a smart addition to your diet.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one half of a raw, medium, pink or red grapefruit (123g) measuring approximately 3 3/4\" in diameter.1﻿ Grapefruit is a low-carb fruit.\nHalf of a medium-sized grapefruit contains fewer carbohydrates and sugar than a typical serving of fruit.\nAccording to USDA data, there are about 13 grams of carbs in a half grapefruit.\nThere are also 2 grams of fiber in a half grapefruit.\nThe glycemic load of half a grapefruit (without any added sugar or honey) is estimated to be 4.\nOne half of a medium grapefruit has approximately 0.2g of fat.\nGrapefruit is an excellent source of vitamin C, providing nearly 64% of your daily needs in a single serving.\nIt's also an excellent source of beta carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A), providing 28% of your daily needs.\nThe vitamins in grapefruit provide several health benefits.\nStudies have shown that taking supplements containing vitamin A, vitamin C, and other nutrients can reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25%.4﻿ Other experts have investigated dietary sources of key nutrients important for eye health.\nIn one published study, grapefruit and grapefruit juice were listed as key dietary sources.5﻿ Pink grapefruit contains the antioxidant lycopene, which gives it its beautiful pink hue.\nA 2015 study suggested that eating a lycopene-rich diet may decrease prostate cancer risk.6﻿ But the topic of vitamin C and cancer prevention has been hotly debated and researchers are not sure if vitamin C supplements or consuming more vitamin C foods can really provide this benefit.7﻿ Research has shown that eating grapefruit is associated with lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and increased HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels in the blood.\nIt may also help to lower blood pressure in overweight adults.8﻿ Researchers who study cardiovascular risk disease factors have investigated grapefruit consumption along with the consumption of other fruits like blueberries, pomegranate, and apples.\nIn a published review, study authors concluded that other fruits were associated with greater benefits with regards to heart health, but that fruit consumption, in general, is likely to help modulate related conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and overweight/obesity.9﻿ Grapefruits contain flavanones which are a subclass of flavonoids.\nFlavonoids have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombogenic, antidiabetic, anticancer, and neuroprotective activities.10﻿ There are reports of citrus allergy, but the condition is considered to be uncommon.11﻿ So while grapefruit allergies are possible, but not likely.\nIf you have an allergy to citrus you should avoid grapefruit.\nYou should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice if you take lipid-lowering (cholesterol-lowering) medications called statins.\nThese may include medications such as Zocor (simvastatin) or Lipitor (atorvastatin).12﻿ Compounds found in grapefruit can interact with the enzymes in your intestines that help your body absorb some types of statins.\nThe interference can affect the levels of statin medications in your blood.13﻿ According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), grapefruit and grapefruit juice can also interfere with other prescription and over-the-counter medications.12﻿ Grapefruit contains a class of compounds called furanocoumarins, which act in the body to alter the characteristics of certain types of medications.\nAnti-anxiety drugs such as buspirone, corticosteroids, and certain organ-transplant rejection drugs may also become less effective if you consume grapefruit.12﻿ Ingesting grapefruit with these medications can cause the body to metabolize the medicines abnormally.\nGrapefruit varieties include pink, white, or ruby red.\nWhite grapefruit has a pale, yellow color on the outside and a pinkish, whitish inside.\nIt's believed that the antioxidant content of citrus fruit increases as it ripens, so choosing a fully-ripe grapefruit is ideal.15﻿ If you plan on eating your grapefruit right away, leave it out at room temperature.\nLike many citrus fruit rinds, grapefruit peel is safe to consume.\nIt even contains some fiber and other nutrients.16﻿ You'll want to wash the fruit before consumption as it may contain bacteria or debris.\nTrying pairing grapefruit with avocado and greens for a refreshing citrus salad, or chop up some grapefruit to make a sweet, tart relish for meats.\nMany recipes combine heart-healthy avocado with ruby-red grapefruit.\nGrapefruit, raw, pink and red, all

Then the beans are blanched for a few minutes before being sealed in cans and then cooked and sterilized in a retort—a machine that’s essentially a big, steam-powered pressure cooker.\n(That’s about as much energy as it takes to drive a car one-quarter of a mile.) Since kidneys and pintos are tougher and take longer to cook—about 75 percent longer than green beans, according to Truitt Brothers, the cannerythat commissioned the study—processing them would require more energy.\nThen there’s the excellent point you raised in your question: Getting those canned beans from the production facility to your local Piggly Wiggly is indeed going to require more fuel.\nBeans, when cooked, get 150 percent heavier because of water absorption.\nIn the green-bean study, for example, getting the cans to the customer accounted for only 8 percent of their overall greenhouse gas emissions.\nBased on some recorded energy figures provided by food researchers at the University of Bristol, cooking five ounces of beans for that long might require 1,400 to 5,600 BTUs on a gas stovetop or 4,100 to 16,500 BTUs on an electric stovetop, though everything from the amount of water to the kind of pot used could alter those numbers.\nThe numbers above assume that the electricity is coming from a coal-fired plant, but as the Lantern has often noted in the past, the fuel mix in your area may be cleaner.) On the high end, that’s a lot more energy than the industrial cookers use—even if we assumed that canning dry beans was twice as energy-intensive as canning green beans, cooking those beans on the stove would take up to 11 times as much energy as at a commercial facility."

        "2": "If she liked to make you green beans (and you listened to her), you’re going to be pretty happy about all the good green beans nutrition does for your health.\nFrom helping prevent many types of disease to supporting the health of your digestive system, green beans nutrition is a dynamic fighter to add to your healing diet because green beans are some of the best high-antioxidant foods on the planet.\nIn addition to the incredible nutrient content that you may recognize from a typical nutrition Facts list, green beans nutrition also contains high levels of several proteins, carotenoids and other antioxidants that make it a veritable mine of nutrition.\nOne of the most heavily researched benefits is in the ability of green beans nutrition to help prevent and stop the spread of several cancers throughout the body.\nWhile one of the reasons for this is the high antioxidant load in green beans nutrition, which help scavenge free radicals in the body responsible for many diseases, one overview study that compiled decades of research on the health benefits of green beans (and other varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris beans) found that: “The anticarcinogenic activity of beans is related to the presence of resistant starch, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, as well as other microconstituents such as phytic acid, protease inhibitors, and saponins.” (3) Basically, this refers to the fact that nutrients present in green beans help exert anticarcinogenic properties in the body, independently from the antioxidant activity found from green beans nutrition.\nResearch also supports that in addition to preventative measures, peptides in green beans can also slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.\n(5) Eating varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris is also associated with slowed or inhibited growth of leukemia, breast cancer and lymphoma cells.\nIt’s suggested that people who consume high quantities of dietary lutein have a lowered risk of breast, colon, cervical and lung cancer, and green beans is No. 8 on the list of foods highest in lutein.\nMany health practitioners also use vitamin C to supplement chemotherapy drugs, as the vitamin helps the drugs target only the cancerous cells, rather than the entire body.\nHIV/AIDS is associated with a number of health risks because it attacks T cells that normally help your body fight off infection.\nThe study from Hong Kong found that the green beans nutrition from French green beans significantly inhibited reverse transcription in HIV-1 cells, the more common form of HIV found throughout the world.\nThese findings suggest that green beans, along with antiretroviral therapy and other HIV/AIDS-fighting foods like spirulina, may be a long-term treatment solution for patients suffering from these viruses.\n(6) When you consume whole-grain foods, such as beans and other legumes, three or more times in one week, you can decrease your risk of diabetes up to 35 percent.\nOther risk reduction methods for this disease include consuming foods with a low glycemic index.\nDue to of the type of dietary fiber and carbohydrates found in green beans nutrition, these veggies are considered a low glycemic index food because the carbohydrates release slowly in your system and help avoid spikes and dips in glucose levels in your blood.\nBeans are among the best whole-grain foods to eat, especially if you’re monitoring your glucose levels and are already at risk for obesity or diabetes, because other popular whole-grain foods like baked potatoes and rice often have a high glycemic index, usually somewhere between 50 and 85, whereas beans score a low 20 on the scale.\nNot only do foods like green beans affect your potential risk of diabetes, but if you already have diabetes, your diet is crucial to managing this chronic condition.\nLow glycemic index diets are strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and regulate the diet-insulin responses of people with diabetes and prediabetes, and can also help your body properly process insulin.\nIn fact, hypoglycemic foods, including Phaseolus vulgaris, have been shown to decrease the glucose tolerance curve (a measurement tool used by physicians and researchers to observe the progression of glucose intolerance) by almost 5 percent more than the most commonly prescribed drug for diabetes.\nTheir findings show that various Phaseolus vulgaris beans, including green beans, can be used as one way to nutritionally control diabetes.\n(8) Other studies focus on the inflammation associated with diabetes and have found species of Phaseolus vulgaris beans play a key role in reducing this inflammation.\n(9) As I just mentioned, green beans are an excellent food for managing glucose levels in people at risk for obesity because they’re a whole grain that scores very low on the glycemic index scale.\nAdding green beans to a balanced meal is clinically proven to help you lose weight by reducing your blood glucose levels, making you feel full and slowing the secretion of the hunger hormone, ghrelin, that causes your brain to desire to eat again.\nBeans help support heart health by managing metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions associated with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\nAgain, this can be explained in part by the resistant starch and dietary fiber content of beans, because they delay the use of glucose from foods, change the way your body uses fat and increase satiety (the satisfied feeling you have after eating) to control the appetite.\nConsuming legumes four times or more a week can decrease the risk of heart disease up to 22 percent versus eating them once a week.\nSimilarly to their mechanism for helping maintain healthy eating and treating diabetes, this is because legumes like green beans are whole-grain, high-fiber foods that score low on the glycemic index scale.\n(11) Another study found an inverse association between legume consumption and coronary heart disease, discovering that eating just ¾ cup of beans daily decreased the risk of heart attack by an astounding 38 percent.\nGetting enough vitamin K in your diet helps protect the lining of your arteries and other body tissues, as well as reduces inflammation to maintain healthy blood pressure and reduces your risk of heart attack.\nLow levels of lutein are also associated with hardening of the artery walls, and high lutein in the bloodstream is connected with a reduced risk of coronary disease and heart attack, although the reasons why are still unclear.\nGreen beans and other legumes are excellent sources of nutrition for those at risk for infertility, as they’re low on the glycemic index and also contain significant levels of folate and iron, three factors specifically indicated in nutrition-based research on improving fertility and beating infertility.\nThe fiber in green beans also helps your digestive system maintain optimal health, as it prevents many digestive problems.\nThat protection, combined with a regular dietary intake of vitamin B12 and vitamin C, helps your body absorb iron (also found in green beans nutrition), which also impacts digestive health.\n(17) Because of its high vitamin K content, green beans nutrition can also help your body build and maintain strong bones.\nWhile they have many benefits, there are a few cautions to consider when eating green beans regularly, one being the presence of oxalic acid (common in many green vegetables).\nAlways drink plenty of water to help reduce your risk, and consult your doctor if you have a history of oxalate urinary tract stones before consuming large amounts of green beans."

new supplement, medicine or treatment to achieve a healthy diet, stay on trend with the health crazes or even to help on-going medical conditions.\nWith the ever growing upwards curve of gluten free, dairy free and meat free diets and intolerances, being able to achieve health benefits from a naturally grown food, like green peas, is great for today’s complex and ever changing diet requirements.\nAlthough not the lowest calorie snack or side dish, green peas are high in dietary fibre and protein.\nThe combination of high carbohydrates, fibre and protein are what make green peas an amazing plant based food for dieting.\nPlant based foods are a new trend that have taken off in the health and diet industry due to their many health benefits.\nHowever, most do not hold as many health benefits or great nutritional value.\nGreen peas are considered one of the most powerful plant based foods there are in comparison to how little of the food you need to reap the benefits.\nIt is high in protein and high protein foods are perfect for weight management as they slow down digestion and help you feel fuller for longer.\nEating a high protein diet can reduce your appetite, make you eat less and result in weight loss.\nIn a 2008 study, professionals found that eating a high protein diet can increase thermogenesis which is a process that influences energy expenditure, therefore results in the body burning more calories.\nGreen peas have a high antioxidant content, consisting of flavonoids and polyphenols, both of which have anti-aging effects.\nEating a good amount of green peas can provide great antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.\nDue to their high antioxidant content, the plant based food has inflammation fighting properties.\nTherefore, the anti-inflammatory properties found in green peas are highly beneficial to help inhibit or fight these inflammation diseases.\nGreen peas fibre and protein content can naturally reduce blood sugar levels.\nGreen peas contain a high amount of antioxidants, which are great at preventing cell damage that can lead to high blood pressure.\nHigh fiber diets are known to improve digestion.\nGreen peas also contain insoluble fiber, which acts as a bulking agent in the body and helps move food along, making digestion easier.\nIt is important to not consume too many green peas as this can cause bloating issues.\nAlthough you can purchase vitamin A supplements that can offer the same benefits for your immune system, it’s best and a cheaper alternative to consume them in the natural form regularly.\nSo adding green peas into your diet is a simple and effective way of supporting your immune system.\nDue to the high fiber and protein content present in green peas, they provide a slow release of energy.\nMany legumes can help improve heart health but the reason green peas are so effective is because of their vitamin content.\nIt has been scientifically proven that fiber rich foods can help with constipation, which green peas are.\nGreen peas contain 4 grams of fiber per half cup, which is a substantial amount of fiber if you consume that or a full cup from just one low calorie food.\nThe lectin content in green peas and other legumes are closely associated with bloating and other stomach issues.\nIt is also advised not to load up too heavy on green peas as the high fiber content can cause a reverse effect on bowel movements and sometimes slow them down even further.\nIt is important to balance any food in your diet and never over consume.\nA new approach to weight management and appetite control is low calorie, high protein diets.\nFoods such as green peas are a great source of protein with a relatively low calorie content, making them ideal for weight loss.\nTherefore, designing a diet to eat foods that are low in calorie but high in protein can work efficiently to combat the issue.\nHigh protein foods help curb appetite and due to their slow release of energy, which helps you feel fuller for longer and weight loss is typically the end result.\nFor its numerous anti-inflammatory and antioxidant health benefits such as fighting off diseases like Alzheimer’s, arthritis and osteoporosis, green peas are quite incredible.\nThey are packed full of antioxidants, vitamins and nutrients to help fight or reduce a range of medical conditions and health concerns.\nThese reports acknowledge and support the health benefits all discussed above due to the nutritious values green peas have.\nLet’s take a look at some facts, advice and frequently asked questions: Like most legumes, green peas are very healthy if consumed in recommended dosages.\nHalf a cup of green peas contains around 61 calories and 4 gram of proteins, with an equal amount of fiber.\nGreen peas have recently been processed and manufactured into protein powders to help you gain muscle (due to their high protein content and health benefits).\nCompared to other vegetables and some legumes such as carrots, green peas have a much higher protein content, which is great for weight management and appetite control.\nAs they are a legume and not a vegetable, consuming more than half a cup will not increase your five a day count.\nWhatever way you choose to consume peas, fresh, frozen or canned, always make sure to rinse them well before cooking as the manufacturing and processing methods means there will be a high sodium content present.\nAs well as eating peas fresh from their harvest or frozen from the supermarkets, many diet companies have developed a pea protein powder.\nSeeing as green peas have high protein value, they have been considered a great plant based alternative for protein powders.\nHowever, all peas contain a high protein content and this new development is groundbreaking for a food that has been around for centuries as is considered a low budget food.\nGreen peas are from a plant that produces pods, which is where the pea is from, just like other legume.\nThey are a healthy nutritious food that is good to consume as a snack or alongside a meal.\nThey provide the body with a lot of protein and fiber which is good for weight management and it’s antioxidant effects.\nHowever, make sure to not over consume as there can be side effects from eating too many.\nGreen peas have a deceptive nutritional value that boasts many health benefits.\nTheir high antioxidant, vitamin and minerals content also contributes to these benefits.\nAfter many studies and conclusive results, green peas are in fact an incredible food to consume daily to attain these benefits and support your body.\nThey are easily available across the world and this access means most people can enjoy them, enrich their diets and consume for their health benefits.",

        "2": "The haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a saltwater ray-finned fish from the family Gadidae, the true cods.\nIt is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and associated seas where it is an important species for fisheries, especially in northern Europe where it is marketed fresh, frozen and smoked; smoked varieties include the Finnan haddie and the Arbroath smokie.\nThe haddock has the elongated, tapering body shape typical of members of the cod family.[2] It has a relatively small mouth which does not extend to below the eye; with the lower profile of the face being straight and the upper profile slightly rounded, this gives its snout a characteristic wedge-shaped profile.\nThere are also two anal fins and in these there are 21 to 25 fin rays in the first and 20 to 24 fin rays in the second.[3] The anal and dorsal fins are all separated from each other.[6] The pelvic fins are small with an elongated first fin ray.[7] The upper side of the haddock's body varies in colour from dark grey brown to nearly black while the lower part of the body is dull silvery white.\nIt also occurs around Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea in the Arctic.[6] The largest stocks are in the North Sea, off the Faroe Islands, off Iceland and the coast of Norway but these are discrete populations with little interchange between them.\nOff North America, the haddock is found from western Greenland south to Cape Hatteras, but the main commercially fished stock occurs from Cape Cod and the Grand Banks.[9] The haddock is a demersal species which occurs at depths from 10 to 450 m (33 to 1,500 ft; 5.5 to 250 fathoms), although it is most frequently recorded at 80 to 200 m (300 to 700 ft; 40 to 100 fathoms).\nOff Iceland and in the Barents Sea, haddock undergo extensive migrations, but in the north western Atlantic its movements are more restricted, consisting of movements to and from their spawning areas.\nTheir lifespan is around 14 years.[6] The most important spawning grounds are in the waters off the central coast of Norway, off the southwest of Iceland, and over the Georges Bank.[10][11] The fish which spawn in inshore waters are normally smaller and younger fish than those which occur in offshore areas.\nOnce hatched the larvae do not appear to travel far from their spawning grounds, however some larvae spawning off the west coast of Scotland are transported into the North Sea through the Fair Isle-Shetland Gap or to the northeast of Shetland.[12] In their larval stages, haddock mainly feed on the immature stages of copepods and the pelagic post-larvae up to 3–10 cm (1–4 in) in length prey on krill, Larvaceans, decapod larvae, copepods and on small fish.\nAdults prey on fish such as sand eels, Trisopterus esmarkii, Hippoglossoides platessoides, gobies, European sprat, and Atlantic herring, as well as capelin, silver hake, American eels and argentines.[4] When a number of fish taken at the same time have their stomach contents sampled, the majority of stomachs contain similar prey, this suggests that haddocks feed in shoals.[10] Shellfish, sea urchins, brittlestars and worms are also important prey,[9] especially in the winter.[12] Juvenile haddock are an important prey for larger demersal fish, including other gadoids, while seals prey on the larger fish.[10] The recorded growth rates of haddock underwent significant change over the 30 to 40 years up to 2011.[10] Growth has been more rapid in recent years, with haddock attaining adult size much earlier than was noted 30–40 years ago.\nThere is some evidence which indicates that these slower growth rates may be the result of an exceptionally large year class in 2003.[11] The haddock stock periodically has higher than normal productivity; for example in 1962 and 1967, and to a lesser extent, 1974 and 1999.\nThe specific name is a latinisation of the vernacular names “Egrefin” and “Eglefin”, used in France and England.[17] Haddock is fished year-round using gear such as Danish seine nets, trawlers, long lines and gill nets and is often caught in mixed species fishery with other groundfish species such as cod and whiting.\nThe main fishing grounds in the eastern Atlantic are in the Barents Sea, around Iceland, around the Faeroe Islands, in the North Sea, Celtic Sea, and in the English Channel.\nThe haddock populations in the western Atlantic (offshore grounds of Georges Bank off New England and Nova Scotia) are also considered to be harvested sustainably.[28] Haddock is very popular as a food fish.\nTraditional Grimsby smoked fish (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smokehouses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations.[36] Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.\nThese fishing grounds are sustainably managed[37] and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.[38] One popular form of haddock is Finnan haddie which is named after the fishing village of Finnan or Findon in Scotland, where the fish was originally cold-smoked over smouldering peat."

        "1": "Brown rice's health benefits are partially due to the way it is prepared, according to the George Mateljan Foundation for the World’s Healthiest Foods, which promotes the benefits of healthy eating.\nBrown rice is a whole grain, meaning that it contains three parts of the grain kernel: the outer, fiber-filled layer called the bran, the nutrient-rich core called the germ, and the starchy middle layer called the endosperm, according to the Harvard T.\nWhite rice, in contrast, is a refined grain, meaning that the bran and the germ have been removed, leaving just the endospore, HSPH says.\nSome of these nutrients —including B vitamins and iron — are added back to \"enriched\" white rice, but fiber is not added back, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).\nAccording to HSPH, the fiber in brown rice helps lower cholesterol, moves waste through the digestive tract, promotes fullness, and may help prevent the formation of blood clots.\nBrown rice is considered a low \"glycemic index\" food.\nLow-GI foods have a rating of 55 or less; the average GI for brown rice is 55.\nAs a part of an overall healthy diet, whole grains may help improve cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, according to the AHA.\nIn 2012, Consumer Reports published an article stating that while arsenic is naturally present in a variety of foods, it is more likely to contaminate brown rice because brown rice absorbs a great deal of water while growing.\nHowever, the Food and Drug Administration analyzed over 1,000 rice samples, and in 2014 stated, \"the arsenic levels that FDA found in the samples it evaluated were too low to cause any immediate or short-term adverse health effects.\" The FDA advised maintaining a diet that includes a variety of whole grains.\nBrown rice, like all grains, should be rinsed thoroughly under running water, and any dirt or debris should be removed.\nTo cook brown rice, add one part rice to two parts boiling water or broth.\nBrown rice takes longer to cook than white rice because the fibrous bran layer and nutrient-rich germ layer have been removed, HSPH says.",
        "2": "In moderation, brown rice can be a very nutritious gluten-free carbohydrate and healthy rice choice overall.\nBrown rice nutrition doesn’t have too many calories per serving, but the nutrient content certainly is up there, whether we’re talking brown rice eaten on its own or brown rice protein powder.\nRice nutrition is actually an important topic since about half of the world’s inhabitants (especially East and Southeast Asia) is completely reliant on rice as a staple food in their daily diets.\nRefined carbohydrates like white rice are basically fake foods and do nothing to promote the health of your body.\nBrown rice nutrition, on the other hand, is loaded with vitamins and minerals as well as fiber and protein to balance the carbs in brown rice.\nScientific studies has even shown that brown rice nutrition can reduce the risk of developing diabetes as well as heart problems.\nIt’s also a safe choice for anyone following a gluten-free diet.\nStudies also demonstrate that getting your magnesium from your diet rather than supplements is likely preferable, especially for people who have already suffered heart attacks in the past.\nOne of the most impressive attributes of brown rice nutrition is its extremely high manganese content per serving.\nManganese isn’t talked about as much as some other nutrients, but it’s extremely important to optimal health.\nIt’s an important trace mineral needed for many vital functions, including nutrient absorption, production of digestive enzymes, bone development, formation of blood-clotting factors and immune system defenses.\n(6) Whole grain foods like brown rice contain both fiber and bran.\nThis is why brown rice offers so many more health benefits than white rice — it still has its bran content.\nStudies have shown that the rice bran and fiber contained in brown rice may be able to lower unhealthy cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol.\n(7) Scientific research has shown that opting for brown rice instead of white rice may actually decrease your risk of developing diabetes.\nA 2010 study out of Harvard School of Public Health revealed that if you consume a little over two servings of white rice (about 12 ounces) per week, making the switch to brown rice could decrease type 2 diabetes risk by an estimated 16 percent.\n(8) This isn’t to say that white rice causes diabetes, but brown rice definitely appears to lower the risk of developing diabetes, thus making it a better choice for anyone following a diabetic diet plan.\nSimilar to oatmeal, brown rice is a naturally gluten-free food as long as it’s not contaminated by gluten-containing substances.\n(9) Many people who avoid gluten in their diets can easily fall short on fiber and the beneficial B vitamins found in whole grains.\nBrown rice nutrition facts are quite impressive and definitely beat white rice nutrition any day.\nWhen brown rice is further processed to remove the bran as well, then it becomes white rice and loses most of its nutrients as a result of this processing.\nHighlights of brown rice nutrition include high amounts of manganese, selenium, magnesium, phosphorus and B vitamins.\nA half cup of cooked brown rice only contains a little over 100 calories, and brown rice nutrition is plentiful.\n(12) Unless white rice is enriched, it really doesn’t offer the consumer much of anything in terms of nutrients so white rice nutrition is basically nonexistent.\nHowever, the less popular black rice aka “forbidden rice” is actually even more impressive than brown rice nutrition, but it does contain a lot more calories for the same serving.\nThese whole grain rices are naturally high in B vitamins and other nutrients.\nWhite rice, however, has to have B vitamins added into it in order to provide any white rice nutrition.\nSince brown rice still has the healthy natural oils of the germ, it also has a shorter shelf life compared to white rice.\nI also highly recommend soaking and sprouting your brown rice before cooking it, which has been found to decreases allergens and phytic acid content while increasing the absorption of nutrients.\nBrown rice generally needs more cooking time than white rice.\n(Kind of how you would cook pasta — six to 10 parts water per one part rice.) Scientists proved this method could reduce arsenic levels, especially inorganic arsenic, in rice by up to 40 percent.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and healthy recipes in the world...Sign up to get VIP access to his eBooks and valuable weekly health tips for FREE!"

        "1": "Because it manages one-third of New Zealand’s land mass, including the five kiwi sanctuaries, the Department of Conservation (DOC) is a key player in protecting kiwi habitat.\nCommunity-led kiwi conservation groups are also big players, with more than 80 now established throughout New Zealand, protecting tens of thousands of hectares.\nMany forest owners and managers are also doing their bit to protect the kiwi that make a home among their trees.\nCreating pest and predator-free sanctuaries brings benefits for many of New Zealand’s other native plants and animals, as well as kiwi.\nPossums not only disturb kiwi nests, they also eat Powelliphanta (New Zealand’s giant carnivorous land snail) and the eggs and chicks of many other native birds.\nStoats are as deadly for native insects, bats and other native birds as they are for kiwi.",

        "1": "That’s because kiwi nutrition provides an insane amount of health benefits.\nKiwi’s beneficial phytonutrients combined with the fantastic lineup of vitamins and minerals kiwi nutrition provides create a delicious, nutrient-dense fruit with an impressive list of health benefits.\nKiwi nutrition is super heart-healthy thanks to the high levels of potassium — which helps prevent low potassium — fiber and vitamin K.\nKiwi nutrition has elements that help with bone growth and maintenance, eye and vision health, and can even help you sleep better, among the following benefits.\nOne reason kiwifruit is undeniably a superfood is because it’s a high-antioxidant food that fights free radical damage.\nIn one study conducted by the Department of Chemical Toxicology, Division of Environmental Medicine at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, kiwifruit was supplemented to a normal diet and showed that with just one to two golden kiwifruit a day, a marked decrease in internal oxidative damage occurred.\n(1) A big reason for this is that vitamin C levels in kiwifruit outshine oranges and provide benefits that help repair and maintain a number of body tissues and systems.\nAside from the high levels of vitamin C and E, both natural antioxidants, kiwifruit is also rich in polyphenols that have immunostimulatory activity, meaning they can prompt an immune system response.\n(3) According to research published in the Journal of Cellular Physiology, the polysaccharides in kiwifruit are able to double collagen synthesis in the body, compared to normal conditions when this activity reduces as we age.\n(4) Kiwi is also host to a carotenoid and antioxidant called lutein, which is incredibly beneficial to skin health by protecting the skin from UV light, marking yet another kiwi nutrition benefit.\nKiwifruit and other fruits high in vitamin C content have been used successfully to treat a number of respiratory illnesses.\nTwo studies have shown beneficial reactions in both adults and children suffering from asthma and other respiratory illnesses and infections after adding kiwifruit to their diets.\nBoth studies concluded that the fruit was able to enhance the vitamin C concentration in the body, which was able to reduce the symptoms of the patients, including decreasing wheezing, head congestion and duration of sore throat.\n(5, 6) Kiwi nutrition’s supply of lutein not only protects the skin, but is also a powerful phytochemical that can prevent many diseases of the eye, including age-related macular degeneration.\n(8) Along with lutein, kiwifruit has a great supply of another carotenoid, vitamin A, which is also largely beneficial to optimum eye health.\nA number of studies have shown kiwi helps reduce complications related to irritable bowel syndrome as well as inflammatory bowel disease.\nThe findings of the studies suggest that adding kiwi to patients’ diets introduced antioxidants and fiber, which were able produce anti-inflammatory results, as well as overall improvements in bowel function.\nOne kiwi a day can provide a lower risk of stroke, blood clots and cardiovascular diseases.\nThe fiber found in kiwi is also very heart-healthy, along with vitamin K, which is able to prevent the buildup of calcium in the arteries and therefore able to reduce the risk for heart attacks.\nStudies have shown that people who regularly consume kiwifruit have 15 percent lowered triglyceride levels compared to those who do not.\n(12, 13) Kiwifruit is also a great source of omega-3s, magnesium, vitamin E and copper, all of which help keep the cardiovascular system working properly.\nStudies suggest that diets high in vitamin K can improve bone health and reduce the risk of bone-related injuries and diseases like osteoporosis.\n(14) Another kiwi nutrition benefit is its serotonin content.\nThe serotonin in kiwifruit has been shown to increase sleep time and sleep efficiency by 13 percent and 5 percent, respectively, so if you can’t sleep, kiwi may help.\n(16) Thanks to polysaccharide content and the abundance of antioxidants found in kiwi nutrition, studies in mice have shown anti-tumor and reduction of cancer cells.\nBoth green and golden kiwifruit have shown antifungal and antibacterial capabilities in several studies.\n(19) The golden kiwi fruit contains a protein called actinchinin, which is suggested as the origin of its antifungal capabilities.\nThese capabilities may also be connected to the large number of antioxidants in the fruit.\n(20) Both known for their high vitamin C content, kiwifruit and oranges are both great, healthy options to add to your diet.\nThere are only a few differences in kiwi nutrition benefits vs.\nSame goes for fruit salads, because the kiwi actually has the ability to tenderize itself as well.\n(22) Individuals on beta-blockers should consume kiwifruit in moderation, as the potassium found in the fruit can alter the potassium levels to higher than is healthy.",
        "2": "Perfect on yogurt parfaits or in frozen fruit bars, it's a delicious addition to countless recipes.\nKiwi fruit is available fresh, frozen, or dried.\nRegardless of variety, check the ingredients list on frozen or dried options to ensure the product is only from the fruit and nothing else.\nAlthough traditional kiwi fruit has green flesh, there are a few different types of equally delicious kiwi fruit varieties available.\nBrondo says that they are known for having the highest vitamin C content of any other commonly eaten fruit (290% DV per serving).\nUnlike green kiwis, Brondo says that you can bite into a golden kiwi just as you would an apple.\nKiwi berries are another kiwi fruit variety that has been gaining popularity recently.\nBrondo suggests adding kiwi to infused water, tossing it in a smoothie, using it as a salad topping, or mixing slices into yogurt for a perfect pairing of probiotics and prebiotics.\nBrondo also shares that both green and gold kiwifruit contain a natural enzyme called actinidin that breaks down protein and makes a delicious marinade."

        "2": "Nowadays, eating lamb, beef, pork, chicken, seafood and processed meat is a daily occurrence for the average family.\nBut these farming practices are not sustainable and there is a significant environmental impact of eating meat.\nAt some point, we’re going to have to address the problems caused by the mass production of animal products and the toll it’s taking on our environment.\nRaising this number of animals takes vast amounts of land and water at a time when both of these commodities are becoming scarce.\nAnimal waste releases harmful gases such as methane which pollute our air, water and soil.\nAnd it’s thought that the farming of livestock is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gases.\nIf you want to change your meat eating habits, so you’re consuming the most environmentally friendly meat, you need to understand the impact of different meats.\nLet’s take a look at each meat in turn, starting with lamb, the least sustainable meat.\nBased on figures from the Meat Eaters Guide to Climate Change and Health report, lamb has the highest carbon footprint.\nEven before beginning its journey to our supermarkets, lamb produces an average of 20.44 kg of C02 emissions per kg of product.\nCattle farming uses billions of gallons of water and, like sheep, cows produce methane as a by-product.\nAgain, food miles need to be considered and the environmental impact will depend whether the beef is grown in the UK or imported.\nIt’s carbon footprint rises as the meat is transported and turned into processed meat.\nThese birds do not produce methane and need less food and water than sheep and cows.\nIf you want to minimise your carbon footprint without giving up meat, chicken is your best option.\nChicken produces 2.33 kg of C02 per kg of meat before transport and processing.\nOnly time will tell but at the moment it’s worth considering wild game as an alternative meat.\nAll too often the question of environmental friendliness becomes synonymous with emissions – greenhouse gases and carbon emissions – and focuses on discussions pertaining to climate change.\nTo truly assess how environmentally friendly meat is we also need to factor in the impact on land, water and biodiversity.\nThe way animals are farmed, and the impact those methods have on the environment, is just as important as the carbon footprint of the meat itself.\nOrganic farming is an agricultural system that focuses on sustainability and biodiversity, and is designed to concentrate on using natural resources and prohibits the use of synthetic substances.\nWhile not exclusively applied to animal husbandry, organic farms attempt to raise organic livestock and poultry in natural living conditions using natural, organic feed.\nUnder the strict organic regulations it’s widely accepted that organic farming provides environmental benefits but there are concerns as to whether animal welfare is any better than in traditional farming.\nMuch of the developed world relies on intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production to cater for the increasing demand for meat.\nIntensive farming is also cited as contributing to global issues such as decreased public health, land degradation and deforestation, increased pollution and poor water management.\nHistorically this intensive method of animal agriculture has been agreed as the most efficient solution for meeting the global demand for meat.\nWhere industrial farming put animals and the environment at the bottom of the list of priorities, regenerative agriculture does the exact opposite.\nAs the name suggests, regenerative agriculture focuses on regenerating soil, biodiversity, water systems and carbon sequestration by taking a conservation and rehabilitation approach to farming.\nIt’s all well and good knowing that there are a series of different farming methods, but tracking down how your chosen meat was farmed is an entirely different matter.\nTransparency is still lacking across our food systems, so if you want to know where your meat has come from and how it was farmed you’ll need to do some digging.\nWhichever meat you choose to consume there will be some negative environmental impact of eating meat.\nIt can be difficult to find sustainable meat in the UK, especially if you’re looking in the supermarket.\nIf you aren’t willing to give up meat, then it’s best to opt for the most sustainable meat you can find that fits your budget.\nThat might mean that you have to eat less meat, but that’s probably a good thing anyway.\nAre you looking to eat less meat but don't know where to start?"

        "0": "Additionally, we will examine the science-backed health benefits of lamb to show why it is one of the healthiest foods around.\nLamb is a kind of red meat because it has a high myoglobin content, an iron-rich protein found in the muscle of animals.\nMyoglobin contains heme, which is a pigment that gives meat its red color (1).\nLamb is a nutrient-dense food, and it is rich in protein, vitamins and essential minerals.\nBefore we get started looking at the health benefits, many people wonder how lamb compares to mutton nutritionally.\nAs sheep eat large quantities of grass throughout their life, mutton meat becomes very fatty and imparts a much stronger flavor.\nHowever, some people have a taste preference for the higher fat content and stronger flavor.\nThe nutritional value of lamb is impressive; it contains a range of beneficial nutrients including protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.\nCompared to most meat, lamb also has a much higher omega-3 content.\nL-Carnosine is a compound that contains two amino acids (proteins) bonded together; beta-alanine and histidine.\nOnly certain foods contain carnosine in high amounts, and lamb is one of these.\nPer 100 grams, lamb contains – on average – 400mg of carnosine, which is slightly higher than beef (365mg) (6).\nHowever, recent research is showing that higher amounts of carnosine from external sources may offer additional health benefits.\nLamb is extremely rich in protein, and depending on the cut it contains anywhere between 25 – 30 grams per 100 grams (11, 12, 13).\nIn other words; the efficiency by which our body can use protein differs depending on the specific food and the amino acids it contains.\nOn the positive side, lamb contains every amino acid, and we can, therefore, class it as a ‘complete’ protein.\nProtein is incredibly important for our health, and it encourages lean muscle mass, the growth and repair of cells, and higher levels of satiety (14, 15, 16).\nWhile some people like to judge food based on how many calories it contains, the caloric load says little about the food’s relative health merits.\nAs one such animal, lamb tends to be an excellent source of omega-3.\nIn pasture-raised lamb, the levels of omega-3 are higher than grain-finished animals.\nMany different foods contain iron and it is present in everything from spinach and kale to bananas and tomatoes.\nImportantly, lamb contains a rich source of heme iron in amounts similar to other red meat such as beef.\nRed meat is the most substantial dietary source of creatine and lamb contains approximately 300-500 mg per 100 grams (24).\nAlthough this is not close to the same level as creatine supplement dosages (3 – 5 grams per day), it should still have a physiological benefit – especially for those eating higher amounts of lamb and beef.\nOn this note, a further health benefit of lamb is that it contains glutathione (28).\nAlso, it contains all three amino acids that our body requires to synthesize glutathione internally.\nLamb contains a source of the natural trans-fatty acid CLA.\nFirstly, don’t worry about the name ‘trans fat’ because the naturally occurring version found in animal foods is much different from synthetic trans-fat (29).\nTo illustrate this point, the people with higher levels of CLA were likely consuming more meat and dairy (and probably less refined carbohydrate).\nEither way, lamb meat is richer in CLA than any other meat and contains approximately 4 – 19.0 mg CLA per gram of fat content.\nSome people still worry about the cholesterol content of animal products due to the decades of warnings against dietary cholesterol.\nLamb is a very nutritious food that is full of protein, healthy fats and a wide range of micronutrients.\nAll in all, lamb is possibly the best choice of meat for those looking for the most health benefits.",
        "1": "Being rich in high-quality protein and many vitamins and minerals, lamb can be an excellent component of a healthy diet.\nLamb is mainly composed of protein but also contains varying amounts of fat.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of roasted lamb provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Like other types of meat, lamb is primarily composed of protein.\nThe protein content of lean, cooked lamb is usually 25–26% (1Trusted Source).\nLamb meat is a high-quality protein source, providing all nine essential amino acids your body needs for growth and maintenance.\nThus, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of roasted lamb provides 6.9 grams of saturated, 7 grams of monounsaturated, and only 1.2 grams of polyunsaturated fat (1Trusted Source).\nSaturated fat has long been considered a risk factor for heart disease, but many studies have not found any link (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nCompared to other ruminant meats — such as beef and veal — lamb contains the highest amounts of CLA (9Trusted Source).\nCLA has been linked to various health benefits, including reduced body fat mass, but large amounts in supplements may have adverse effects on metabolic health (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).\nLamb is a rich source of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.\nAs a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and high-quality proteins, lamb can be an excellent component of a healthy diet.\nMeat is one of the best dietary sources of high-quality protein.\nThis increases your risk of sarcopenia, an adverse condition associated with very low muscle mass (26Trusted Source).\nIn the context of a healthy lifestyle and adequate exercise, regular consumption of lamb — or other high-protein foods — may help preserve muscle mass.\nBeta-alanine is found in high amounts in meat, such as lamb, beef, and pork.\nDiets low in beta-alanine — such as vegetarian and vegan diets — may decrease levels of carnosine in your muscles over time (33Trusted Source).\nAs a rich source of highly available iron, lamb may help prevent anemia.\nObservational studies have revealed mixed results on the link between red meat and heart disease.\nSome studies find an increased risk from eating high amounts of both processed and unprocessed meat, whereas others note an increased risk for processed meat only — or no effect at all (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\nMany people believe that meat causes heart disease because it contains high amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat — impairing the blood lipid profile.\nHowever, most scientists now agree that dietary cholesterol is not a risk factor for heart disease (25Trusted Source).\nMany studies have not been able to link saturated fat with an increased risk of heart disease (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nLean lamb has been shown to have similar effects as fish or white meat, such as chicken (47Trusted Source).\nStill, you should avoid eating high amounts of cured lamb or meat cooked at high heat.\nIt’s debated whether eating lamb increases your risk of heart disease.\nA number of observational studies show that people who eat a lot of red meat are at an increased risk of colon cancer over time (48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source).\nSeveral substances in red meat may increase cancer risk, including heterocyclic amines (53Trusted Source).\nStudies consistently indicate that eating overcooked meat — or other dietary sources of heterocyclic amines — may increase the risk of various cancers, including of the colon, breast, and prostate (56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source).\nThough there is no clear-cut proof that meat intake causes cancer, it seems sensible to avoid eating high amounts of overcooked meat.\nEating a lot of red meat has been linked to increased cancer risk.\nNot only is it a rich source of high-quality protein, but it is also an outstanding source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12.\nOn the negative side, some observational studies have linked a high intake of red meat to an increased risk of cancer and heart disease.\nLamb contains saturated fats, which can increase cholesterol levels, but there are ways to limit your exposure.\nEating processed meat is linked to increased risk of several diseases, including cancer.",
        "2": "Maybe you have never given lamb a try or maybe you already love it, but either way, you may be wondering if lamb is a healthy meat choice.\nIn moderation, lamb is an excellent source of protein and vital nutrients like iron, zinc, selenium and vitamin B12.\nYes, lamb is a type of red meat and you probably know that red meat often gets a bad rep, but high-quality red meats like grass-fed beef and grass-fed lamb are excellent and truly healthy protein sources in moderation.\nI’m about to answer a lot of common questions about lambs, including what is a lamb, the difference between lamb and sheep, how lamb can boost your health, and also some of the tastiest and healthiest lamb recipes around.\nRed meats have a high myoglobin content, which is a protein found in muscle that changes to red when it’s mixed with oxygen.\nOne ounce of regular lamb (not grass-fed) has the same number of calories as grass-fed beef but actually has more health-promoting omega 3 fatty acids.\nA baby lamb is a sheep that’s under one year old, and the meat that comes from a sheep at this young age is called lamb.\nSo mutton is the meat of a sheep that’s over the age of one.\nFor example, just three ounces of lamb contains approximately the following: (3) As a red meat, lamb inherently has a lot more iron than other protein sources like chicken or fish.\nHeme iron is the more absorbable form of iron so consuming red meat like lamb can help to improve and prevent iron deficiency and anemia symptoms.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, the bioavailability of iron is approximately 14 percent to 18 percent when someone consumes a diet that includes significant quantities of meat, seafood as well as vitamin C, which boosts iron absorption.\n(5) Other studies, like one published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2000, indicate that this number might be even higher, with up to 39 percent of the population possibly suffering from a vitamin B12 deficiency.\n(6) Lamb is an awesome source of B12 with just three ounces of lamb meat providing just under half of most people’s daily B12 requirements.\n(7) In case you’re not entirely sure why the nervous system is so important, this system is essentially the body’s electrical wiring that’s responsible for helping the entire body properly communicate and function.\nThis nutrient can be found in cells throughout our bodies, and it’s absolutely essential to optimal immune health, along with wound healing, DNA and protein synthesis, as well as growth and development in children.\n(8) Consuming lamb meat and other zinc-rich foods can help keep your zinc levels in a healthy place and boost your overall immune function.\nIn addition, zinc helps enable optimal senses of taste and smell (two very important things when you’re consuming some tasty lamb meat).\nMany people are aware of the many benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, but not too many realize that lamb meat is a noteworthy source of these healthy fatty acids.\nGrass-fed lamb meat also provides its consumers with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).\nFor starters, CLA has been shown to help aid fat loss, improve lean muscle mass and animal studies have even shown it may be a potential cancer fighter (especially breast cancer) in humans.\nThe protein found in lamb meat is made of essential amino acids, which can only be obtained through our diets.\nAnimal protein sources like lamb meat are considered “complete proteins” because they contain all essential amino acids.\nOther non-meat protein sources, like vegetables, grains and nuts, typically do not contain at least one or more essential amino acids.\nMany health stores carry lamb meat too, and much of the time it’s local lamb meat.\nIt’s also best to buy organic and grass-fed to get the highest-quality lamb meat possible.\nJust like grass-fed beef has a bumped-up array of nutrients and health benefits, so does grass-fed lamb meat.\n(14) A Garlic Lamb Roast Recipe and other rack of lamb recipes are very popular, especially around holidays like Easter and Passover, or for other large gatherings.\nIn case you’re at a loss for a delicious lamb recipe, here are some of my favorite ways to consume lamb.\nThese lamb recipes are loaded with flavor as well as nutrients: Lamb has been considered a religious symbol, specifically a symbol of sacrifice, since ancient times.\nIf you experience a stuffy nose, a runny nose, feel nauseous or suddenly have a rash after consuming lamb, then it’s possible that you’re allergic to lamb.\n(16) Lamb, like other red meat, does contain a significant amount of cholesterol so it should be enjoyed in moderation, especially if you have high cholesterol.\nTrimming lamb fat can help keep the cholesterol levels of lamb meat down.\nIn moderation, high-quality (organic and grass-fed) lamb meat is an awesome, healthy protein source that offers a wide range of concentrated and health-boosting nutrients.\nFor instance, lamb is an excellent iron source, nervous system health promoter, immune booster, rich source of healthy fats and protein powerhouse.\nDr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide

        "0": "D.A.C. PINK, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 Leek is a self-compatible outbreeding tetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) belonging to the diverse species complex Allium ampeloprasum L., which includes wild and cultivated forms with ploidy levels of 4x, 5x, and 6x, tetraploidy being the most common.\nIts tolerance of low temperatures together with the absence of photoperiod requirements or a bulb resting stage make leek extremely adaptable, and it is grown as a vegetable crop worldwide.\nThe objectives for leek breeding in the UK are the improvement of winter-hardiness, resistance to bolting, dark-green leaf blade (“flag”) color, and resistance to leek rust.\nIn addition to these improvements in quality, breeders also aim for improvement in yields, and European breeders have been concerned to obtain resistance to leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV).\nLong shaft length is desirable, particularly for processing, and improvement in uniformity is also important as variability in size is a major limiting factor in the marketability of the crop.\nG.P.F. Lane, in Lockhart & Wiseman’s Crop Husbandry Including Grassland (Ninth Edition), 2014 Leeks can be harvested by hand or machine.\nRoots need trimming back but care is needed not to damage the base plate of the leek.\nampeloprasum var porrum (L.) Gay) are related to garlic and bear a resemblance to onions, shallots and scallions.\nLeeks look like large scallions, having a very small bulb and a long white cylindrical stalk of superimposed layers that flows into green, tightly wrapped, flat leaves.\nLeeks look like large scallions, having a very small bulb and a long white cylindrical stalk of superimposed layers that flows into green, tightly wrapped, flat leaves.\nCultivated leeks are usually about 30 cm in length and 5.0–8.5 cm in diameter, and feature a fragrant flavour that is reminiscent of shallots but sweeter and more subtle.\nLeek plants resemble large onion plants with flat leaves.\nUnlike onion and garlic, leeks do not form bulbs or produce cloves.\nLeeks are made up of sheaths of basal leaves that can be 15–25 cm long and 5 cm in diameter.\nThe taste of leeks is milder than those of onion and garlic.\nThe leek is a tall, hardy, biennial with white, narrowly ovoid bulbs and broad leaves.\nMany cultivars selected for long, white, edible bases and green tops, winter hardiness, and resistance to bolting are available for cultivation.\nThese cultivars differ from one another mainly in length and diameter of the sheath part, leaf spacing, breadth and colour of leaf blades, vigour and bolting, and resistance to cold.\nResistance to cold is of special importance where leeks are to be harvested throughout the winter, while slowness to bolt permits a prolonged harvest period in the spring (McCollum, 1976).\nRather than forming a tight bulb such as the onion, the leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths which are generally blanched by pushing soil around them (trenching).\nOnce established in the garden leeks are hardy; many varieties can be left in the ground during the winter to be harvested as needed (Anon, 2005a).\nLeek was an important vegetable for the Greeks and Romans, and its use later spread throughout medieval Europe.\nToday, leeks are an important vegetable in many northern European cuisines and are grown in many European countries (Anon, 2005a).\nS. Jain, in Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003 Leek varieties have been classified into a number of major types that differ in pseudostem length and slenderness, leaf color, winter hardiness, and the tendency for bulbiness.\nLonga: very long, high-yielding leeks with pale green leaves and little frost resistance.\nKing Richard: long, high-yielding types with pale to mid-green leaves, suitable for late summer production and frost-susceptible.\nPancho: long leek with mid-green leaves, limited frost resistance, and a tendency to form bulb.\nTilina: medium to long leaves, with pale to mid-green, rather spreading leaves, frost-resistant.\nVerina: medium shank length, dark leaf varieties, tendency to form bulb.\nGoliath: medium shank length, mid-green, spreading leaves, little bulbing, very frost-hardy, high-yielding.\nBleu Star: short leeks with dark leaves and a high degree of bulbiness, very hardy, low-yielding.\nThe leaves are dark green with white stems.\nPancho is considered an early leek, has thick white shanks, and resists bulbing.\nAmerican Flag is very hardy and cold-resistant, and has large, thick shanks; it blanches to clear white with blue-green leaves.\nCompared to onion, leek contains more protein and minerals.\nThe energy value of 100 g of edible portion of leek is also higher than that of onion.\nLeeks are harvested when their stalks reach a size of 2.5 cm or more in diameter and are tenderer.\nFanny Ribarova, in Diet, Microbiome and Health, 2018 Leek and three varieties of onions: white, red, and green (fresh) were investigated.\nAnalysis was conducted separately on the feathers, the white part of the stem, and on the whole vegetable to study the accumulation of flavonols in different parts of the plant in more detail.\nRed onions contain the highest amounts of quercetin among all tested vegetables with an average of 45.25 mg/100 g and maximum of 83.22 mg/100 g.\nIn onions, similar to other fruits and vegetables, quercetin is mostly accumulated in the outer layers of the bulb.\nWe have found that spring onion leaves contains quercetin (3.02–6.11 mg/100 g) and kaempferol (2.74–5.23 mg/100 g) and the white part of the onion has large amounts of quercetin (11.02–23.05 mg/100 g).\nSimilar to the results for green onions, kaempferol in leeks is detected only in the green part of the stem, but unlike fresh onions, quercetin in leeks is detected neither in the green nor in the white part of the plant stem.\nTo properly peel the skin, the border plate between stalk and root must be cut.\nFor this reason, a machine vision system that enables the precise detection of the position of the border plate between stalk and root in leeks is a key technology for leek peeling.\nAn image of a leek root just before cutting at the plate between stalk and roots.\nOperators manually feed leeks onto the line of preprocessing machines, and once the position of the border plate is determined, the leeks are cut to a length of 60 cm.\nThe monochrome cameras indicate the position of the border plate, while the color cameras detect the border between green leaves and white stalk for the third step.\nIn the third step, the positions of the leeks on the line are adjusted so that the borders between green leaves and white stalks match with the positions of installed air nozzles.\nAfter peeling, several cameras inspect the length, width and bend of the white stalk as well as the number of leaves.\nARMSTRONG, in Genetic Improvement of Vegetable Crops, 1993 The three recognized species of leek rust (Puccinia allii, P.\nfistulosum, onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) being one of the most important.\nAbe, in Using Cereal Science and Technology for the Benefit of Consumers, 2005 The Welsh onion, scallion and leek were farm-cultivated (Yahiro Sangyo Co. in Gifu, Japan), and powders were prepared using a vacuum dehydrator with a balance chamber drying system (Yahiro Sangyo).\nAllium powder such as Welsh onion, scallion and leek was blended with wheat flour; the substitution levels are indicated in Table 1.\nWelsh onion (1%), scallion (5.0%) and leek (0.5%) powder, and Pro2S2 (0.1%) and Me2S2 (6.3 mg%) were blended with wheat flour, respectively.\nM.G. Jones, in Fruit and Vegetable Flavour, 2008 Onions and garlic, along with leeks, spring onions (A.\ncepa), are used in cooking worldwide and onions are the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes (Griffiths et al., 2002).\nThe excellent storage properties of onion and garlic mean that they have been traded worldwide for longer than other vegetables.",

        "1": "They’re also a good source of vitamin K1, which is necessary for blood clotting and heart health (3Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, wild ramps are particularly rich in vitamin C, which aids immune health, tissue repair, iron absorption, and collagen production.\nLeeks are also a good source of manganese, which may help reduce premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and promote thyroid health.\nLeeks are a particularly great source of kaempferol, a polyphenol antioxidant thought to protect against heart disease and some types of cancer (9, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).\nThey’re likewise a great source of allicin, the same beneficial sulfur compound that gives garlic its antimicrobial, cholesterol-lowering, and potential anticancer properties (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, wild ramps are rich in thiosulfinates and cepaenes, two sulfur compounds needed for blood clotting and thought to protect against certain types of cancer (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16).\nSeveral studies link alliums to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke (17Trusted Source).\nWhile most of these studies have tested onions or garlic, leeks contain several beneficial compounds thought to lower inflammation and protect heart health (18).\nKaempferol-rich foods are associated with a lower risk of heart attacks or death due to heart disease (10Trusted Source).\nMoreover, leeks are a good source of allicin and other thiosulfinates, which are sulfur compounds that may benefit heart health by reducing cholesterol, blood pressure, and the formation of blood clots (13Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, leeks are a good source of water and fiber, which may prevent hunger, promote feelings of fullness, and help you naturally eat less (21Trusted Source).\nThey also provide soluble fiber, which forms a gel in your gut and is particularly effective at reducing hunger and appetite (22Trusted Source).\nAdding leeks or wild ramps to your diet can boost your overall vegetable intake, which may increase this effect (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).\nLeeks are also a good source of allicin, a sulfur compound thought to offer similar anticancer properties (26).\nAnimal studies reveal that ramps grown in selenium-enriched soil may help lower cancer rates in rats (27Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, human studies demonstrate that those who regularly consume alliums, including leeks, may have up to a 46% lower risk of gastric cancer than those who rarely eat them (28Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, high intake of alliums may be linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nThat’s in part because they’re a source of soluble fiber, including prebiotics, which work to keep your gut healthy (31Trusted Source).\nSCFAs can reduce inflammation and strengthen your gut health (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that a prebiotic-rich diet may aid your body’s absorption of important nutrients, which can boost your overall health (34Trusted Source).\nAlthough leeks aren’t studied as rigorously as onions and garlic, emerging research suggests that they may offer additional benefits.\nLeeks and wild ramps boast a variety of nutrients and beneficial compounds that may improve your digestion, promote weight loss, reduce inflammation, fight heart disease, and combat cancer.",
        "2": "These vegetables are not only nutritious, but they also have a delicious flavor and help to enhance the taste of various dishes.\nThis article provides a guide to leeks and their nutritional values, potential health benefits, and how to use them.\nPer 3.5 oz (100-gram) serving, they provide the following vitamin content (1, 2): As shown, leeks are an excellent source of vitamin K, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin C.\nVitamin K is necessary for the formation of prothrombin, a type of protein that plays an essential role in coagulation (clotting), which helps the body to heal from wounds.\nSimilar to other vegetables in this group, leeks contain organosulfur compounds (11).\nSulfur is currently classed as a non-essential mineral, but like other non-essential compounds, it may offer health benefits (12).\nOn this note, a variety of studies have demonstrated that organosulfur compounds play a regulatory role in enzymes that both detoxify and activate carcinogens (11, 13, 14).\nIn research relating specifically to leeks, a case-control study featuring 285 women found that a higher intake of leeks was significantly associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (15).\nFurthermore, numerous observational studies find an association between Allium vegetable intake and reduced risk of several different cancers (11, 16, 17, 18, 19).\nFurther human research is necessary to examine the relationship between Allium vegetables and cancer risk more clearly.\nHowever, there is currently no relevant human research on a high dietary intake of quercetin and kaempferol from plants, so more research is necessary to determine whether there is any benefit (24).\nResearch has also shown that quercetin and kaempferol have anti-cancer effects in studies using human cells (26, 27).\nAlthough dietary kaempferol and quercetin may have benefits, there is no human clinical research to suggest either can prevent or treat cancer (26).\nCarotenoids are a class of phytonutrients that are precursors to vitamin A, which is why they are sometimes referred to as ‘provitamin A.’ Leeks are a particularly rich source of a carotenoid called lutein, and data shows that they provide 36.8 mcg of this carotenoid per gram (22).\nSauteed leeks have a delicious flavor, and they make an excellent side to any meat, fish, or protein-based food.\nLeeks contain a beneficial range of vitamins and minerals.\nFurthermore, their content of organosulfur compounds, polyphenols, and carotenoids may potentially offer further benefits.\nSince leeks also taste delicious and contribute large amounts of flavor to food, they’re an excellent addition to any diet."

        "0": "There is growing concern about the environment and farming practices, and how our food production and distribution systems may be contributing to problems such as transport pollution, global warming, ill health and loss of wildlife.\nThe Food Facts series of reports provides information about the negative and positive effects of food production and consumption on our environment and society.\nOne of the more startling facts to emerge from the Salad Days report was the amount of pesticides applied to lettuces.\nIn one ten year study by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF), pesticide applications had increased by 600%.\nOne study in Murcia found that the amount of nitrates leaching into the environment was more than would usually be applied by a UK lettuce farmer.\nAs a result the European Commission has imposed maximum limits of nitrate residues that may be found in lettuces and spinach.\nOn average over 1 in 20 lettuces in the UK were found to exceed maximum limits on nitrate residues.\n(For spinach an alarming 1 in 3 leaves exceed the maximum limit.) Again Salad Days found that the number of samples used for testing nitrate residues in lettuce was too low.\nFor example, in 1998, only 9 imported lettuces were tested for nitrate residues.\nIt is important to support sustainable lettuce production to ensure that lettuces remain a part of the diet.\nDr. Tim Lobstein, The Food Commission Food Facts: A series of short reports on over a dozen different products, shows how people's shopping choices - as well as government policy - can protect the environment, enhance social justice and improve health.\nsustain@sustainweb.org Sustain advocates food and agriculture policies and practices that enhance the health and welfare of people and animals, improve the working and living environment, promote equity and enrich society and culture.",
        "1": "The issue is that the original Carnegie Mellon study on which the claim was based looked at energy, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions on a per calorie basis.\nAnd that’s why comparing the environmental impact of different foods based on their calorie content can be a little misleading — it’s not as if people cutting 400 calories worth of bacon out of their diet are going to supplement that with 400 calories worth of lettuce (or approximately four heads of Romaine).\nIt set out to answer how shifting our current diets — which tend to be high in calories, red meats, and grains and low in fruits and vegetables — to a USDA recommended diet, which is higher in fruits, vegetables, and meats like poultry and seafood, would impact energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use.\n“For the typical American, following those recommendations would mean eating more seafood and much, much more dairy, both of which have a larger environmental footprint.” And that’s basically what the Carnegie study confirmed, finding that the USDA recommended diet — with its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and seafood — had higher emissions, energy use, and water use than current diets: farm energy increased by 38 percent, and greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent.\nIn bumping up the fruits and vegetables of an average diet to meet the USDA recommendations, Fischbeck and his colleague relied on consumers’ current preferences for fruits and vegetables, prioritizing things that Americans tend to eat a lot of, like cucumbers, celery, bell peppers, and tomatoes — all things that tend to be pretty low in calories.\nThe study did not look at how changing fruit and vegetable preferences to things that are both higher in calories and lower in emissions — convincing Americans to eat more cabbage or beans, instead of celery and tomatoes — would impact the environment.\nWhat we’re saying is that based on the preferences we have, those tend to be, on average, more intensive than the pork products.” The study didn’t look at a vegetarian diet — just a diet as recommended by the USDA, which includes eating less meat, but more seafood and dairy.\nThe Carnegie Mellon study isn’t wrong — if Americans were to reduce their meat consumption and supplement those lost calories with things like low-calorie fruits and vegetables or seafood and dairy, any decrease in emissions from reduced meat consumption could be offset by increased emissions elsewhere.\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that meat production — especially inefficient meat, like beef — has detrimental impacts on the environment; even the Carnegie Mellon study says that “meats and fish/seafood have the highest average GHG emissions” of any of the food groups looked at.\nThe answer isn’t replacing all of the calories that we would get from meat with low-calorie options like lettuce or celery, or high-emissions alternatives like dairy and seafood.",
        "2": "The investigation conducted by FDA, CDC, and state partners determined that consumption of romaine lettuce was the cause of the outbreak.\nTraceback of the romaine lettuce consumed by ill people determined that it originated in the Yuma produce growing region which consists of farms in Imperial County, California, and Yuma County, Arizona.\nThe traceback identified a total of 36 fields on 23 farms in the Yuma growing region as supplying romaine lettuce that was potentially contaminated and consumed during the outbreak.\nWith the exception of one instance where one of the legs of the traceback led to a single farm, it was not possible to determine which, or how many, of these farms shipped lettuce that was contaminated with the outbreak strain of E.\nThe epidemiological and traceback analyses performed during this outbreak informed an FDA-led Environmental Assessment (EA) of the Yuma produce growing region in collaboration with CDC and state partners from June through August 2018.\nThese three samples were collected in early June from a 3.5 mile stretch of an irrigation canal near Wellton in Yuma County that delivers water to farms in the local area, including several identified in the traceback as having potentially shipped romaine lettuce contaminated with the outbreak strain.\nThe EA was conducted over several visits by various members of a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in produce safety, agriculture, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, microbiology, environmental health, and sanitation from FDA and the CDC, with valuable contributions from the Arizona Department of Agriculture, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture.\nThe team relied upon the content of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule and Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) as the basis for assessing potential contributing factors that could have led to contamination of romaine lettuce on farms identified in the traceback.\nAreas of focus on these farms included but were not limited to: Similarly, the EA team and FDA investigators used FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Foods Rule and applicable guidance as the basis for assessing potential contributing factors that may have led to the contamination of romaine lettuce during manufacturing/processing operations in FDA registered food facilities.\nAreas of focus for the manufacturing/processing operations included but were not limited to: As part of the EA, the team conducted in-depth interviews with produce farm management and fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facility management during on-site visits.\nThe traceback investigation identified the locations visited, and the EA team collected information regarding relevant food safety procedures, policies, and practices.\nThe traceback indicates that the contaminated lettuce had to have been grown on multiple farms and processed at multiple off-farm fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facilities.\nHowever, the EA team still visited farms identified in the traceback as potentially shipping contaminated romaine lettuce that was consumed during the outbreak, where they made observations and, when appropriate, sampled those fields and adjacent areas.\nFDA also conducted a regulatory inspection and observed manufacturing/processing of leafy greens at a fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facility identified via traceback investigation.\nThe EA team appreciates the cooperation of farms, fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facilities, cattle feeding operations, and water districts in the Yuma growing region that were contacted during this investigation.\nFDA and our partners at CDC identified 28 foodborne illness outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing E.\nSTEC contamination of leafy greens has been identified by traceback to most likely occur in the farm environment.\nContamination occurring in the farm environment may be amplified during fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing if appropriate preventive controls are not in place.\ncoli O157:H7, is not considered to be an environmental contaminant in fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing plants.\ncoli O157:H7 infections in humans occur from consuming contaminated food.\ncoli O157:H7 illnesses identified in the Yuma growing region prior to the time of the likely contamination event, therefore a human source for the outbreak is considered unlikely.\nThe outbreak strain was identified in three samples of water collected along a 3.5 mile stretch of an irrigation canal in the Wellton area of Yuma, County.\nFDA considers that the most likely way romaine lettuce became contaminated was from the use of water from this irrigation canal, since the outbreak strain of E.\nFDA cannot rule out that there are other sources or means of romaine lettuce contamination that were not identified during the EA investigation.\nInformation collected by the EA team indicates that, among the Yuma area farms identified in the traceback and that were interviewed, irrigation canal water was only directly applied during germination.\nHowever, aerial and ground-based spraying of crop protection pesticides diluted with irrigation canal water occurred at various times during the growing season on a number of these farms, including after a freeze event that occurred in late February.\nThe EA team did not identify an obvious route for contamination of the irrigation canal from this facility; in addition, the limited number of samples collected at the CAFO also did not yield the outbreak strain.\ncoli O157:H7 contamination of the romaine lettuce from some of the growing fields identified in the traceback could have been amplified by commingling cut romaine lettuce in wash systems at fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facilities.\nWashing of romaine lettuce either at a fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facility or at home by consumers may reduce but will not eliminate pathogens, including STEC, from romaine lettuce.\nThe commingling of romaine lettuce from various farm growing fields at fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facilities complicated traceback efforts and made it impossible for FDA to definitively determine which farm or farms identified in the traceback supplied romaine lettuce contaminated with the E.\nIn only one leg of the traceback involving whole head lettuce was FDA able to identify a single farm as having supplied contaminated lettuce.\nFDA was not able to conduct regulatory inspections and observe the manufacturing/processing of leafy greens at all fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing facilities identified in the traceback investigation because many of these facilities were not in operation due to the end of the growing season and the manufacturing/processing equipment that may have been used was no longer available for inspection.\nFDA has identified the following factors and findings as those that most likely contributed to the contamination of romaine lettuce from the Yuma growing region with E.\nThese factors demonstrate the importance of implementation of the FSMA Produce Safety Rule provisions and GAPs on farms as well as the FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Foods Rule provisions, in manufacturing/processing facilities and throughout the supply chain."

        "1": "This incredible citrus fruit may seem pretty ordinary, but it’s actually a powerhouse of nutrition.\nBursting with both vitamin C and antioxidants, limes — like lemons — possess a powerful set of health benefits.\nIn fact, limes may be able to help amp up weight loss, enhance immunity, boost iron absorption, prevent kidney stones, improve heart health and even fight off cancer.\nBest of all, this fruit is widely available and easy to add into your diet, making it the perfect way to give your health an easy upgrade with minimal effort required.\n(1) Studies show that eating lime fruit could reduce several heart disease risk factors and may help give your heart health a boost.\nOne animal study in Iran, for example, showed that treating rabbits with lime juice and lime peels helped slow the progression of atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque on the artery walls.\nA study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at the diets of 126,399 adults over an eight- to 14-year period and found that each serving of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 4 percent decreased risk of coronary heart disease.\nResearchers also noted that leafy green vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruits and veggies, like limes, had the greatest impact.\n(3) For best results when it comes to heart health, include limes as part of a balanced diet and combine with a healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity.\nThis is because limes are jam-packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that fight against the harmful free radicals that can cause cell damage and chronic disease.\n(5) Other test-tube studies have shown that lime may be effective against other types of cancer as well, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.\n(9) Pair limes with a nutritious diet full of fruits and vegetables, limit your intake of ultra-processed foods, and squeeze in some exercise a few times per week to see the most results when you step on the scale.\nGetting enough vitamin C in your diet is important for many aspects of health, but it’s especially crucial when it comes to immunity.\nOne review published in the Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism found that meeting your vitamin C needs could help reduce the duration and severity of respiratory tract infections and could also help prevent and improve the outcomes for malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.\nIncluding a few servings of lemons or limes in your diet is one of the easiest ways to kick kidney stones to the curb.\nLike lemons, limes contain a good amount of citric acid, a type of acid that can help prevent kidney stones by increasing urinary citrate and urine volume.\n(12) Although there is limited research looking at the effects of limes on kidney stones specifically, there are many studies showing that increasing your citric acid intake could be beneficial in kidney stone prevention.\n(13) You can also help prevent kidney stones by increasing your fluid intake, eating plenty of magnesium-rich foods and following a plant-based diet.\nA deficiency of this important mineral can result in iron deficiency anemia, a condition that causes anemia symptoms like dizziness, brittle nails, hair loss and fatigue.\nThe vitamin C found in limes can actually help increase iron absorption to prevent iron deficiency anemia.\nIn fact, a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition even found that consuming 100 milligrams of vitamin C with a meal increased iron absorption by 67 percent.\n(14) To maximize your iron absorption, make sure your meals contain a good mix of iron-rich foods, like meat, lentils and spinach, along with plenty of vitamin C foods, such as limes.\nGiven their similarities in taste and nutrition, it’s easy to understand why so many people mix up these two citrus fruits.\nThey’re both packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, supply similar benefits to health, and are both used to bring a bit of flavor and zing to recipes.\nThe lemon nutrition profile is also a bit more substantial, with higher amounts of several micronutrients like vitamin B6 and folate.\nThey are also widely available at most grocery stores and can be found in the produce aisle, usually right next to the lemons and other citrus fruits.\nScurvy is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency, which can result in symptoms like bleeding gums, bruising and fatigue.\n(16) In 1747, scientist James Lind began conducting experiments on board a naval ship and discovered that drinking lemon and lime juice could help ward off scurvy thanks to the high concentration of vitamin C.\nAlthough uncommon, citrus fruit allergies are can cause food allergy symptoms like hives, swelling, asthma and flushed skin.",
        "2": "Whether sweet or sour, limes have many health benefits.\nThe high levels of Vitamin C found in limes can help protect you from infection and speed up your body’s healing process.\nCitrus fruits have been shown to help keep kidney stones at bay.\nThe citric acid in lemons, limes, and other citrus fruits makes it more difficult for kidney stones to form.\nStudies have shown that the flavonoids found in citrus fruit, including limes, may help protect against stroke, especially in women.\nRegularly eating limes, which are high in Vitamin C, can even help you stave off the common cold.\nCitrus fruits have many health benefits, and limes are no exception.\nLimes also contain small amounts of: Like other citrus fruits, limes are acidic and can damage your tooth enamel when eaten in large quantities.\nIf you're allergic to other citrus fruits, you might be allergic to limes."

Instead, it’s that the number of juvenile lobsters that make it to adulthood has dropped in southern New England and risen sharply in the Gulf of Maine.\nThe arrival of the lobster seems like a boon for Mainers, but the thing that pushed them north hasn’t gone away: warming ocean temperatures.\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, from 1982 to 2006, sea surface temperatures in the coastal Northeast warmed by close to twice the global rate.\nSea surface temperature trends in the Gulf of Maine (top) and the global ocean (bottom).\n“Where it’s already warm, like Southern New England, a couple of degrees increase may have some really bad effects.\nYou get above that 20oC threshold too often and you start seeing mass die offs,\" said to Rick Wahle, a research professor at University of Maine's Darling Marine Center.\n“And we’ve seen those, like in Long Island Sound.” The fall of 1999, lobstermen in Long Island Sound saw a huge lobster die-off after a long stretch of anomalous above-average water temperatures.\nAccording to a Connecticut Sea Grant report on the incident, roughly 70% of the lobstermen in Long Island Sound lost 100% of their fishing income that year.\nThe report said the lobster population was “severely stressed by sustained, hostile environmental conditions, driven by above-average water temperatures.” Scientists also identified a new lobster disease that year: paramoebiasis.\nThe scientists reported that the paramoebae were able to infect the lobsters due to weakened immune systems resulting from the long stretch of above-average temperatures.\nLobsters aren’t the only New England marine species feeling the heat.\nHare was the lead author of a recent Fisheries Climate Vulnerability Assessment, in which NOAA researchers examined 82 species in the Northeast —including lobsters —to evaluate how they will be affected by warming ocean temperatures.\nLobsters, scallops, and clams, which live on the ocean bottom and have limited mobility, are some of the species most vulnerable to climate effects in the region.\nIn July 2015, the ICES Journal of Marine Science dedicated an entire supplement to research on lobsters in a changing climate.\nOne of the papers highlighted the importance of climate-related impacts beyond rising ocean temperatures.\nIt’s important to “gain a greater understanding of how hypoxia [low oxygen], ocean acidification, and the shifting ranges of predators and competitors impact the changing geography of lobster distributions,” said the researchers.\nA new study released in September, on which Wahle was a co-author, examined acidification in the context of warming.\nWhile acidification had no real effect on the survival of the larval lobsters, scientists “saw higher mortality rates at the warmer temperatures,” said Wahle.\n“The economy in Maine and the community is very tied to lobster, so any negative climate change impact could have a big effect,” said Hare.\nFrom 1970 to 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada reported lobster landings rose from roughly 33 million pounds to more than 1.5 billion pounds.\nHare said this trend is likely to continue, but it could be slowed down in coming decades by a natural climate pattern known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO).\nThe AMO is an ocean circulation pattern that brings warmed water from the tropics to higher latitudes.\nSince the mid-90s, the AMO has been in a warm phase, amplifying global warming’s influence on North Atlantic temperatures.\nGlobal Average Temperature compared with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) Index through 2009.\nThe AMO Index is the average sea-surface temperature over the North Atlantic Ocean.\nSo it’s [the Northwest Atlantic’s] been warming really fast,” said Hare, who added that scientists aren’t sure if that rate will keep up when the AMO goes colder.\nOn the 100- year scale it’s pretty straight-forward, greenhouse gas emissions cause warmer temperatures both in the air and in the ocean.\nThe story originally stated that sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine were warming 99% faster than the rest of the planet.\nConfronting Climate Change in the U.S. Northeast: Science, Impacts, and Solutions.\nSynthesis Report of the Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment (NECIA).\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/pdf/confronting-climate-change-in-the-u-s-northeast.pdf Hare JA, et al.\n(2016), A Vulnerability Assessment of Fish and Invertebrates to Climate Change on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf.\n(2015), American lobster nurseries of southern New England receding in the face of climate change.",

        "0": "Like shrimp, crab, and crayfish, lobster is a crustacean, a type of shellfish characterized by its segmented body protected by a shell (1Trusted Source).\nThis article explains all you need to know about the nutrition of lobster, including whether the cholesterol it contains should be a reason for concern.\nHowever, cholesterol content is independent of fat content, and a serving of lobster provides 70% of the DV for cholesterol (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA are two types of omega-3 fatty acids that may protect heart health by lowering blood cholesterol levels.\nAlthough lobster provides more protein per serving than the other crustaceans, they are all protein-rich foods.\nLastly, while they are all rich in EPA and DHA, shrimp, crayfish, and crab provide lower amounts than lobster.\nLobster is a lean protein food with high amounts of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nAdditionally, research suggests that high protein foods may aid or promote weight loss by boosting your metabolism and increasing feelings of fullness (11Trusted Source).\nStudies suggest that people who consume diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids have a lower risk of stroke, depression, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).\nSimilarly, research suggests that low vitamin B12 levels are associated with dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease (17Trusted Source).\nHowever, some studies suggest that taking vitamin B12 supplements seems to reduce the risk of dementia by 20% and improve brain function in older adults (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\nTo help prevent this condition, public health initiatives recommend regularly eating fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).\nStudies have repeatedly shown that long-chain omega-3s, such as EPA and DHA, have protective effects against heart disease.\nFish and seafood species that provide high amounts of both — such as lobster — seem to be the most protective (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA may reduce the risk of heart disease in several ways.\nOne 2008 study found that intakes of 566 mg per day of EPA and DHA may reduce heart disease risk by 37% (24Trusted Source).\nIn a 2010 study, participants took up to 234 mg of EPA and DHA per day, and the researchers reported that for participants who took the highest amounts, the risk of heart disease decreased by 49% and the risk of heart attack-related deaths decreased by 62% (25Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that diets rich in EPA, DHA, and selenium may have a protective effect against several types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, gastric, liver, and ovarian cancers (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nTest tube and animal studies have found that the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of omega-3s have reduced tumor growth and spread and led to cancer cell death (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nStudies have shown that selenium may promote tumor death and help prevent cancer from spreading (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nAdding lobster to your diet may have some additional health benefits, thanks to the selenium it contains.\nLobster’s high selenium content may be beneficial for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\nScientists need to do more research to investigate the health benefits of lobster in humans.\nNutrients in lobster may offer beneficial effects for heart and mental health and weight loss.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition While lobster has a relatively high amount of cholesterol, this may not be a health concern.\nSome research suggests that cholesterol from food sources is not associated with heart disease risk (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nHowever, some of these studies have been lower quality, and scientists need to do more high quality studies to investigate this topic further (38Trusted Source).\nOlder studies explain that this is because your body can regulate its cholesterol production based on how much cholesterol you eat (39Trusted Source).\nThus, it maintains the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio and avoids increasing the risk of heart disease (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nResearch has found that about one-quarter of the population is more sensitive to higher cholesterol intakes (37Trusted Source).\nLobster contains a high amount of cholesterol, but this is not a health concern for most people.\nStudies have found that cholesterol from food sources does not appear to increase the risk of heart disease.\nLobster is a highly perishable food that requires proper handling to avoid microbial contamination.\nSome of the most common disease-causing bacteria linked to improperly handled crustaceans — and raw seafood in general — are Vibrio species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella species, and Shigella species (1Trusted Source).\nCrustaceans are some of the most common allergens that may cause severe food reactions, and lobsters are among the most allergenic (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source).\nAs a result of water pollution, lobsters and other shellfish may become contaminated with heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic (1Trusted Source).\nTo keep your lobster on the healthier side, be mindful of preparation and cooking methods that significantly increase calorie and fat content.\nLobster is a type of crustacean rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\nAdding it to your diet may be beneficial for weight loss and mental health and may help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.",
        "1": "It provides a nutritional breakdown of lobster and an in-depth look at its possible health benefits, as well as ways to incorporate more lobster into your diet, and any potential health risks of consuming lobster.\nLobster is a rich source of copper and selenium and also contains zinc, phosphorus, vitamin B12, magnesium, vitamin E, and a small amount of omega-3 fatty acids.\nHowever, recent studies have suggested that not all cholesterol content in foods is harmful to the body and that saturated fat intake is more directly related to an increase in harmful cholesterol levels.\nPolyunsaturated fats can help reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of stroke and heart disease.\nWhile its overall fat content is high, lobster is not a significant source of saturated fat.\nMany studies have suggested that consuming more fish and shellfish decreases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease while promoting healthy cholesterol levels.\nFish and shellfish, such as lobster, are especially important for providing omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in very few foods.\nAlthough the fatty acid content in lobster is not the highest among fish and shellfish, it is still a considerable source of these important nutrients.\nA meta-analysisTrusted Source has shown that those with thyroid disease who are selenium-deficient experience noted benefits when increasing their selenium intake, including improved general wellbeing, enhanced mood, and improved thyroid function.\nMaking sure that a child consumes enough selenium can help reduce the risk of ADHD.\nLobster has one of the highest copper contents of any food.\nWhile lobster may seem like an expensive, decadent treat, eating live-cooked lobsters is not the only way to include this lean, delicious seafood in your diet.\nLobster can contain a moderate level of mercury and should be consumed six times or less per month.\nTo minimize the risk of food-borne illness, buy properly refrigerated, fresh lobster at 40º Fahrenheit (F) or below.\nIt is important to note that the total diet or overall eating pattern is the most important factor for disease prevention and healthy function.\nIt is better to eat a diet with variety than to concentrate on individual foods as the gateway to good health.",
        "2": "However, lobster is also very nutritious, and it provides a wide range of beneficial nutrients.\nThis article provides an in-depth guide to the nutritional values and potential benefits of lobster.\nLobster is a good source of B vitamins, and it also offers a broad range of minerals.\nBased on the nutritional composition of lobster, it offers several potential health benefits.\nPer 100 calories, lobster contains 21.5 grams of protein.\nA typical medium-sized lobster offers approximately 56 grams of protein (1).\nOn the positive side, lobster provides 81 mg of choline per 100 grams, which is equivalent to 15% of the daily value (1, 2).\nLobster contains substantial amounts of copper and selenium; per 100 grams, it provides more than 100% of the daily value for both minerals (1, 2).\nSimilar to other crustacean species of shellfish such as shrimp and crab, lobster shells have a red hue.\nRecent systematic reviews of published studies have found that: Chemical analysis of lobster found that it provides between 54 mcg and 295 mcg astaxanthin per gram.\nWhile lobster doesn’t provide as much omega-3 as oily fish varieties, it does offer a source of these essential fats.\nAs shown in the nutritional values, lobster supplies 0.25 grams of omega-3 per 100-gram serving.\nThis amount is equivalent to 0.75 grams of omega-3 per medium lobster (1).\nShellfish are one of the most common allergens in the human diet, and this is especially true for crustacean species such as crab, lobster, and shrimp (15, 16).\nAccording to this research, here were the mean amounts of mercury contamination in the following lobster species (20): While this level of mercury contamination is not as high as shark (0.979 PPM) or swordfish (0.995 PPM), it is higher than smaller fish like sardines (0.013 PPM) and anchovies (0.016 PPM).\nLobsters contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol; a 3.5 oz (100-gram) serving of cooked lobster provides 145 mg (1).\nLobster has a lot to offer nutritionally: it’s an excellent source of protein, omega-3, B vitamins, and important minerals like copper and selenium.\nThis popular shellfish is also relatively low in mercury and may provide additional benefits from its choline and astaxanthin content."

slightly savoury taste.\nThe lychee and ackee plants belong to the soapberry family, or the Sapindaceae, and contain similar toxins.\nIn specific circumstances, unripe lychees can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and a dangerous brain dysfunction that may be deadly.\nAckee fruits that are not ripe can cause severe vomiting and other unpleasant symptoms.\nLychees and ackee fruits are both available in North America, at least in some places and at some times of the year, either in fresh or canned form.\nCare is needed when choosing and preparing them, however, especially in the case of ackee fruits.\nB. navez, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License The lychee or litchi plant is an evergreen flowering tree that is native to China.\nTheir taste and nutrients make them a great fruit to eat.\nIt's important that they're ripe, however, at least until we have a better understanding of the fruit's potential toxicity.\nUnripe lychees are completely green in colour.\nEver since the 1990s, investigators have been seeking an explanation for the puzzling deaths of Indian children after eating lychees.\nThe analysis was based on poisonings that occurred in 2014 in an area containing many orchards with lychee trees.\nThe poisonings took place from May to July, which is the lychee season, and were absent during the rest of the year.\nThe affected children visited the orchards and ate lots of lychees.\nAfter eating unripe fruit, the children went to bed without exhibiting any symptoms.\nThe researchers discovered that many of the affected children—especially those that died—didn't eat evening meals or ate only small ones.\nIt's possible that hunger was the reason for the willingness of some children to eat unripe lychees.\nThe researchers found that many of the children ate so many lychees that they didn't want an evening meal even when it was available, however.\nThe combination of eating a large number of lychees without eating an adequate amount of other food produced the most serious symptoms.\nUnripe lychees contain two toxins—methylenecyclopropyl glycine or MCPG and hypoglycin A.\nThe investigators found metabolites of the toxins in many of the children that ate the unripe fruit.\nTherefore, after eating a sufficient number of unripe lychees children may experience hypoglycemia.\nThis harms the brain and is responsible for the dangerous and distressing symptoms of lychee poisoning.\nThe synergistic combination of litchi consumption, a missed evening meal, and other potential factors such as poor nutritional status, eating a greater number of litchis, and as yet unidentified genetic differences might be needed to produce this illness.\nThe investigators say that the solution to the lychee problem is for parents to warn their children about eating the fruit and to ensure that the children get a good evening meal.\nUnfortunately, in 2019 the lychee season caused more children to die in northern India, where the trees grow well.\nAs of mid June in that year, 31 children had died after eating the fruit.\nThese ackee fruits haven't opened up and are therefore unripe and dangerous to eat.\nJerome Walker, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License Like the lychee plant, the ackee plant (Blighia sapida) is an evergreen tree.\nThe edible part of the fruit is the cream or pale yellow flesh or aril round the seeds.\nThe cooked ackee is a rich yellow colour and looks a lot like scrambled eggs.\nIt's very important to eat only ripe ackee fruits and to eat only the properly prepared aril.\nAckee poisoning is also known as Jamaican vomiting illness.\nChildren are more likely to die from the illness.\nSome of the symptoms of the illness are the same as ones found in lychee poisoning.\nAs the alternate name for the illness suggests, severe vomiting is a dominant symptom of ackee poisoning.\nVomiting occurred in some of the children investigated in the lychee poisoning analysis, but not in most of them.\nSome common symptoms of ackee poisoning are listed below.\nI've eaten lychees, which are available in stores and restaurants during the summer where I live.\nI haven't eaten ackee, however, and have never seen it in the stores.\nIf it was available I wouldn't eat it unless I could prepare it myself or unless I was confident that it was prepared by someone who knew how to deal with the fruit.\nUnripe fruit contains a high level of hypoglycin A and is very poisonous.\nRipe fruit still contains hypoglycin A, but the level is much lower.\nIf the ackee is washed and then cooked in water, the amount of toxin should fall to a safe level.\nExperts in dealing with the fruit give the following advice for making ackee safe to eat.\nRik Shuiling/TropCrop, via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 License Canned lychees are available throughout the year where I live.\nCanned ackee is available in some places.\nThis may sound like a safer product than the fresh fruit and would certainly be easier to use.\nIf I was thinking of buying canned ackee, I would do some research about the product and its manufacturer first.\nUnripe lychees seem to be dangerous only under certain conditions; unripe ackees seem to be dangerous for many of us.\nBoth fruits can be interesting additions to the diet but need to be treated with respect.\nThanks for introducing us to foods that need to be processed safely before we consider eating them.\nI remember trying canned lychee once but have never seen or tasted ackee.\nI think that lychees are an interesting fruit.\nI love lychees and they were so abundant in Cambodia that we ate these all the time.\nI haven't seen ackee where I live, either, but I expect it's available in stores that sell imported food.\nI've changed it.) These ackee fruits are fascinating, aren't they.\nI don't recall any of us ever eating a green lychee, as the exterior is green when unripe and red when ripe.\nSounds like an interesting fruit.\nDeep and very interesting sturdy on the ackee and lychee fruits.\nThe good news is that that it seems that we need to eat a lot of unripe litchis before we get sick.\nThese Ackee fruits have an extraordinary resemblance to human kidneys, complete with the adrenal gland up top.\nI enjoy eating fruits that I've never tried before, although I do like to learn something about them before I put them in my mouth!\nThe food that we eat has a bigger effect on our lives than just providing calories.\nI don't mind eating ripe lychees when I can find them, but I wouldn't eat unripe ones.\nDry informative hub about Lychees and Ackee fruits!\nThanks for commenting and for sharing the interesting and useful information, Larry.\nLychees are available where I live, too.\nAckee and saltfish sounds like an interesting meal.\nI have Lychees in china restaurants,  I never head of the Ackee fruits.\nThanks for the valuable information on these two foods.\nI am not familiar with the lychee but I like ackee and saltfish.\nI feel sad for the children who died because they ate the ackees.\nLike many of your hubs, this is vital information for those who eat such fruit.\nI've never heard of Ackee but it's very interesting too.\nI enjoy eating lychees, too.\nI love lychee's."

Dearest Adrian, Grist thanks its sponsors.\nCrunchy, healthy nuts plus chewy, healthy dried fruit plus … oh, I believe you’ve forgotten the most important ingredient in any trail mix: chocolate, of course!\nWe’ve dealt quite a bit with almonds and their water requirements here at Grist, and walnuts and pistachios raise the same issues, so for now let’s skip those.\nI’m not going to tell you to stop eating them altogether – it’s complicated, like most food issues – but it’s good to consider their water footprints all the same.\nPeanuts are packed with healthy fats too, and their sat fat levels are on par with other nuts, like pecans, cashews, and walnuts.\n(Of course, peanuts are technically legumes – but let’s not get too nutty with our sorting here.) And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation’s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in – wait for it – Brazil’s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don’t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou’ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you’re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to give you plenty of permutations for your trail mix, so I do hope you find some recipes to your liking.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate, justice, and solutions.\nYour support helps Grist reveal the under-reported connection between social justice and climate change.",

        "1": "Below are 5 science-backed health benefits of milk so you can decide if it’s the right choice for you.\nMilk is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including “nutrients of concern,” which are under-consumed by many populations (3Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, it’s an excellent source of protein and contains hundreds of different fatty acids, including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and omega-3s (5Trusted Source).\nThe nutritional content of milk varies, depending on factors like its fat content and the diet and treatment of the cow it came from (10Trusted Source).\nFor example, milk from cows that eat mostly grass contains significantly higher amounts of conjugated linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids (11Trusted Source).\nAlso, organic and grass-fed cow’s milk contains higher amounts of beneficial antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, which help reduce inflammation and fight oxidative stress (12Trusted Source).\nMilk is considered a “complete protein,” meaning it contains all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for your body to function at an optimal level (14Trusted Source).\nDrinking milk is associated with a lower risk of age-related muscle loss in several studies.\nIn fact, higher consumption of milk and milk products has been linked to greater whole-body muscle mass and better physical performance in older adults (18Trusted Source).\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Drinking milk has long been associated with healthy bones.\nThis is due to its powerful combination of nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, potassium, protein and (in grass-fed, full-fat dairy) vitamin K2.\nMilk is an excellent source of the nutrients your body relies on to properly absorb calcium, including vitamin D, vitamin K, phosphorus and magnesium.\nAdding milk and dairy products to your diet may prevent bone diseases like osteoporosis.\nStudies have linked milk and dairy to a lower risk of osteoporosis and fractures, especially in older adults (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, milk is a good source of protein, a key nutrient for bone health.\nEvidence suggests that eating more protein may protect against bone loss, especially in women who do not consume enough dietary calcium (27Trusted Source).\nA study in 145 three-year-old Latino children found that higher milk-fat consumption was associated with a lower risk of childhood obesity (28Trusted Source).\nAnother study including over 18,000 middle-aged and elderly women showed that eating more high-fat dairy products was associated with less weight gain and a lower risk of obesity (29Trusted Source).\nFurthermore, the conjugated linoleic acid in milk has been studied for its ability to boost weight loss by promoting fat breakdown and inhibiting fat production (32Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, many studies have associated diets rich in calcium with a lower risk of obesity.\nFor example, unsweetened yogurt made from milk contains the same amount of protein, calcium and phosphorus.\nOthers choose not to consume milk or dairy products due to dietary restrictions, health concerns or ethical reasons.\nMilk is a nutrient-rich beverage that may benefit your health in several ways.\nDrinking milk and dairy products may prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures and even help you maintain a healthy weight.\nFor those able to tolerate it, consuming high-quality milk and dairy products has been proven to provide a number of health benefits.\nEach type of milk has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on a person's diet, health, nutritional needs, or personal taste preferences.\nDairy is the best source of calcium in the diet, the main mineral in bones.",
        "2": "One cup (240 ml) of whole cow’s milk with 3.25% fat provides (1Trusted Source): Milk is a rich source of protein — providing approximately 1 gram of this nutrient in each fluid ounce (30 ml), or 7.7 grams in each cup (240 ml) (1).\nBoth of these groups of milk proteins are considered to be of excellent quality, with a high proportion of essential amino acids and good digestibility.\nOne important property of casein is its ability to increase the absorption of minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus (2Trusted Source).\nWhey proteins have been associated with many beneficial health effects, such as decreased blood pressure and improved mood during periods of stress (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).\nMilk fat is one of the most complex of all natural fats, containing about 400 different types of fatty acids (7Trusted Source).\nIn contrast to trans fats in processed foods, dairy trans fats — also called ruminant trans fats — are considered beneficial for health.\nMilk contains small amounts of trans fats, such as vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (7Trusted Source).\nCLA has attracted considerable attention due to its various possible health benefits — though evidence is still limited (8, 9Trusted Source, 10).\nMilk is an excellent source of high-quality protein and different fats.\nMilk contains all the vitamins and minerals necessary to sustain growth and development in a young calf during its first months of life.\nAs a public health strategy, fortifying milk products with vitamin D is common and even mandatory in some countries (17Trusted Source).\nIn the United States, 1 cup (240 ml) of vitamin-D-fortified milk may contain 65% of the daily recommended allowance for this nutrient (18Trusted Source).\nMore than 50 different hormones are naturally present in cow’s milk, which are important for the development of the newborn calf (19).\nWith the exception of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cow milk hormones have no known effects in humans.\nOnly one of them — insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) — has potential health effects in people.\nCow’s milk seems to have similar effects in people and has been associated with a higher bone density (15Trusted Source).\nThe high calcium and protein content of milk are the two main factors believed responsible for this effect (21Trusted Source).\nDairy products have been linked to a reduced risk of high blood pressure (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nBeing a rich source of calcium, milk may promote increased bone mineral density, cutting your risk of osteoporosis.\nLactose intolerance is most prominent in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America, where its estimated to affect 65–95% of the population (27Trusted Source).\nIn Europe, the estimated prevalence is 5–15%, with people in Northern Europe being the least affected (27Trusted Source).\nMost often, allergic symptoms are caused by whey proteins called alpha-lactoglobulin and beta-lactoglobulin, but they can also be due to caseins (29Trusted Source).\nHigh milk consumption is known to increase levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone thought to be involved in the appearance of acne (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).\nHowever, a fair number of studies indicate that dairy consumption may increase the risk of prostate cancer in men (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).\nConversely, numerous studies have found a link between dairy consumption and a lower risk of colorectal cancer (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).\nMany people are intolerant to lactose, and some are allergic to whey or casein.\nMilk has also been linked to other adverse effects, such as an increased risk of acne and prostate cancer.\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to destroy potentially harmful bacteria that are occasionally found in raw milk (41Trusted Source).\nHomogenization does not have any adverse effects on nutritional quality (43Trusted Source).\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to increase shelf life and minimize the risk of illness from harmful microorganisms that may be present in raw milk.\nHeating results in a slight decrease in several vitamins, but this loss is not significant from a health perspective (44, 45Trusted Source, 46).\nHomogenization — the process of breaking the fat globules in milk into smaller units — has no known adverse health effects (43Trusted Source).\nDrinking raw milk is associated with a reduced risk of childhood asthma, eczema, and allergies.\nAlthough raw milk is more natural than processed milk, its consumption is riskier.\nIt’s during the milking process, transport, or storage that milk gets contaminated with bacteria — either from the cow itself or the environment.\nAlthough the risk of getting ill from drinking raw milk is small, a single milk-borne infection may have serious consequences.\nMost public health advocates agree that any potential health benefits of drinking raw milk are outweighed by possible health risks resulting from contamination with harmful bacteria (48).\nDrinking raw milk is not recommended, as it may be contaminated with harmful bacteria.\nIt’s not only rich in high-quality protein but also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin.\nStill, some people are allergic to milk proteins or intolerant to milk sugar (lactose).\nAt the end of the day, moderate consumption of cow’s milk is healthy for most people — but you should avoid drinking it in excess.\nThis article examines the health effects of dairy products, which seem to vary greatly between individuals.\nThis article investigates if the potential benefits of raw milk outweigh… Each type of milk has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on a person's diet, health, nutritional needs, or personal taste preferences.\nDairy is the best source of calcium in the diet, the main mineral in bones."

        "2": "The study titled ‘Sensitivity of grain yields to historical climate variability in India’ published in the journal Environmental Research Letters explores the susceptibility of the current mix and distribution of crops to variations in temperature and rainfall.\nThe study analyses the impact of historical rainfall and temperature variability on the yields of the ?ve major rainfed grains produced during the monsoon (kharif) season namely, ?nger millet, maize, pearl millet, rice, and sorghum, and the bene?ts of coarse grains over rice in coping with the impacts of climate change on crops.\nHowever, for certain districts and crops, the rainfed yields of alternative grains exceed those of rice, especially for pearl millet and sorghum in central India and maize in many parts of the country.\nThe study finds that rice yields are much more sensitive to fluctuations in monsoon rainfall on both irrigated and rainfed croplands as compared to all other alternative grains.\nIn an extremely hot year, rainfed pearl millet yield is worse than rice while maize and ?nger millet yields are better as compared rice.\nThus, almost all rainfed grain yields, with the exception of ?nger millet are sensitive to variations in monsoon temperatures.All grains could be impacted by an increasingly variable climate, but the degrees to which different grains are impacted differ quite a bit, with rice being the most impacted.\nThe paper argues that while rice continues to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of variable rainfall patterns and temperature changes, increasing coarse grains in crop production can greatly help in developing resilience to climate change in the long run and improving crop production.\nThis can also be combined with other strategies to enhance the resilience of grain supply against climate shocks such as including buffer reserves, improving access to and utilisation of irrigation and more research to develop high-yielding drought-tolerant varieties of dominant crops."

        "0": "The industry of composting urban waste for disposal differs from our mushroom composting goals.\nWhereas our high temperature (160-180 °F) or thermogenic composting process prevents such degradation, and conserves carbon so that the 50% reduction of organic matter occurs during the cropping process.\nThese differences must be emphasized for any reference or comparison with composting waste materials for disposal.\nIt is important that mushroom researchers understand the problems of urban waste composting.\nA future possibility is to build a mushroom farm to use previously composted urban waste.\nWhen the mushroom takes up where the thermophilic organisms stop in recycling the carbon of green plants it uses part of the compost as nutrient in producing its fruiting bodies.\nMost of the compost is left behind as a residue called spent compost, spent mushroom substrate or more recently proposed \"post mushroom substrate.\" This material is ready to be further attacked by a new set of organisms.\nFortunately, post mushroom substrate is not spent and has many uses.\nIt is not simply a matter of making it available, but growers must think of the removal of this substrate as a marketing opportunity: adapting the material to that of the gardeners' needs, further decomposing of the substrate or mixing other ingredients into it to enhance or dilute nutrients.\nIn the areas where many mushroom farms are concentrated near an urban area, the disposal of spent compost is still a problem for most growers.\nAn urgent situation is approaching in some areas and disposal of the post mushroom substrate is essential for the mushroom farmers' survival.\nStudies at the Stroud Water Research Center suggest that the impact to the ground water under post mushroom substrate pile is minimal.\nThe mushroom industry must try to educate not only the community but all possible users about the value of post mushroom substrate.\nLocal garden centers should be telling their customers to use post mushroom substrate as a mulch around newly planted shrubs and add it to their garden soil.\nThe floriculture research done at Vineland, Ontario and other places should be widely distributed as educational material to promote the use of post mushroom substrate in container crops.\nResearch at Penn State and around the world continues to show the value of post mushroom substrate as source of nutrients for many crops and plants.\nSpent compost is a source of nutrients and water holding properties for such crops such as corn and other vegetables.\nThe corn plant is unable to use all the nitrates because of another limiting factor, possibly the organic carbon compounds that hold water.\nIt is possible that spent compost would be an ideal source of organic carbon material to retain the nitrate rich water in the soils.\nPost mushroom substrate, possibly mixed with the fresh animal manure, would allow corn farmers to add the quantity of manure required, without the fear of excess nitrates or nutrients leaching into the ground.\nOther environmental, agricultural and industrial uses of post mushroom substrate were summarized in the proceeding from the SMS Symposium of 1994.\nCompost teas from post mushroom substrate have been somewhat effective in controlling apple scab and late blight of tomatoes.\nHowever, producing a second crop of mushrooms by supplementing spent mushroom substrate with certain additives may be possible.\nBy controlling the ionic activity of calcium and potassium in the compost solution, phosphorus availability is increased and later break yields can be improved.\nHowever development of the mechanism involved in increasing phosphorus nutrition, availability or uptake may increase the amount of substrate consumed by the mushroom and reduce the quantity of post mushroom substrate remaining after harvesting 3-4 breaks.\nOffensive odors from improperly managed drainage catch basins and from the practice of pumping anaerobic water back onto the raw ingredients is often the source of neighbor complaints.\nWater that drains from composting yards and mushroom houses that may pollute the local water supplies has been reduced or most often eliminated.\nEventually all composting operations may have to use plans similar to those suggested by the Soil and Water Conservation Agencies.\nThese agencies have helped several farms in the installation of water runoff containment sites for their composting wharves or spent substrate storage areas.\nIt solves the disposal problem and adds a useful supplement to the compost nutrition.\nIt may be possible that municipal waste composting operations could use mushroom stems as a source of moisture and/or carbohydrates.\nBesides parasitic wasps, other biological control products are available for the growers to use.\nIn the days of the horse and buggy, the mushroom industry provided a valuable way to dispose of a waste commodity.\nUnfortunately, the mushroom business grew faster than the horse racing business, so their waste is now inadequate for our industries' needs and horse manure has become a costly ingredient.\nAnother waste product mushroom farms help to dispose of is poultry manure.\nIt would be more advantageous for both industries if mushroom growers could use more poultry manure in their formulas.\nUnfortunately the mushroom industry uses relatively small amounts of poultry manure.\nTo maintain compost structure for aeration during composting requires a base of organic fibrous material to keep the piles loose and provide carbohydrates for the nutrition of the mushroom.\nPromoting mushroom farming as environmentally friendly should be a long term educational goal of the industry.\nResearchers should be more interested in testing and using agricultural and industrial waste products for mushroom compost.\nGrowers must use the mushroom's ability to consume organic materials discarded by man, to help control pollution in modern society.\nA worst case scenario is the expansion of municipal waste composting facilities to use more organic waste products for the sole purpose of disposing of urban and industry waste.\nThese waste disposal facilities will be designed for a fast, complete and efficient reduction of organic materials.\nMushroom farms will not compete well with these industries for the organic materials required by our crop.",

        "2": "Because of this recycling of other agricultural crops and byproducts, mushroom farms have a smaller environmental footprint than almost any other farms.\nIn fact, when you go into the store and see white or brown “button” mushrooms, you are looking at an incredibly efficient food: Today’s growers use smart management and production practices that use less than 2 gallons of water to produce one pound of button mushrooms – that’s about 32 (8 oz) glasses of water to grow, harvest, and process an entire pound of mushrooms, compared with an average of 50 gallons of water per pound of other fresh produce items.\nProducing one pound of button mushrooms takes 1.0 kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity.\nBecause of the way mushrooms are grown, being smart about energy use is good for production AND good for the environment.\nThis means if you added up all the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas) from producing that one pound of button mushrooms – from the compost recipe all the way through to what you purchase in the store – it is the equivalent of just 0.7 pounds of CO2.\nIn fact, one acre of land can produce 1 million pounds of mushrooms.\nBy any measure of water and energy inputs, and the low CO2 emissions, mushrooms are a nutritious food that have a very small environmental footprint.\nMore than being the ‘ultimate recyclers,’ mushroom growers are providing a sustainable, smart food source for a growing world population.\nAs consumers look to make food decisions that take environmental impacts and carbon footprint into account, mushrooms are a choice that everyone can feel good about.\nNot only are mushrooms delicious and nutritious, they are also a sustainable food consumers can feel good about purchasing.\nMushrooms have 0.5 Kilograms (kg) of CO2 per pound of food consumed."

        "1": "The vitamins and antioxidants found in olives may provide important health benefits.\nNumerous studies have shown that consuming olive oil, especially the extra-virgin variety, may reduce the risk of heart disease and mortality in people who have a high risk of this condition.\nOlives contain the compound oleocanthal, which studies have shown can kill cancer cells.\nOther studies have shown a link between consuming olive oil and reducing the risk of cancers, including breast cancer.\nThe oleocanthal in olives and olive oil is linked to a reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other brain-related diseases.\nResearch shows a link between consuming olive oil and preventing type 2 diabetes by helping the body regulate glucose (sugar).\nOlives are rich in vitamin E and other antioxidants, which may help reduce the risk of health conditions like cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.\nOlives provide many health benefits, but they are still relatively high in fat.\nCanned olives are often packed in brine, which makes them high in sodium (salt).",
        "2": "Known mostly for making versatile, benefit-rich olive oil, olives are bursting with rich phytonutrients and are known for their high vitamin E content, cancer-fighting antioxidants and cardiovascular benefits.\nNative to the Mediterranean regions of Asia, Europe and Africa, olives come in many sizes and varieties, and offer a number of great health benefits.\nThe diet doesn’t encourage reducing fats, but rather replacing unhealthy fats with healthy ones like monounsaturated fats, which are found in olives.\nOlives are a high-antioxidant food that mainly provide polyphenols, which are antioxidants that have proven anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-aging and neuro-protective effects (1, 2).\nOlives even help boost blood levels of glutathione, which is one of the body’s most important antioxidant nutrients because of it’s ability to recycle antioxidants.\nThe benefits from antioxidants like those found in olives transcend almost all body systems and can be a major factor in disease prevention and treatment.\nThe hypotensive (lowering blood pressure) effects of olives are due to the oleic acid they contain.\n(4) Studies have shown significant decreases in blood pressure and overall cardiovascular inflammation after consumption of olives, olive oil and other food items in the Mediterranean diet.\n(6) Inflammation also plays a large role in cardiovascular disease, which is another reason olives are heart-healthy.\n(7, 8) There is promising evidence that olives are some of the best cancer-fighting foods around.\nOlives nutrition has all of the things needed for a healthy heart and cardiovascular system: antioxidants, anti-inflammatory capabilities, healthy fats, as well as a great supply of copper and Vitamin E, both of which are important for optimum heart health.\nA diet containing olives can not only treat symptoms of heart disease, but it has also been proven to significantly reduce the risk of heart-related complications, even in individuals with genetic predisposition to high blood pressure and heart problems.\n(9, 10) Olives nutrition can also help prevent coronary heart disease.\n(11) A review of studies published in the European Journal of Nutrition showed that the phenolic compounds in olives can increase the number of good bifidobacteria, which produce vitamins and antibacterial chemicals in the body.\n(12) Because olives are high in monounsaturated fats, they greatly reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity when substituted for foods containing other, more harmful fats.\n(13) A review published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition studied the effects of olive oil consumption on type II diabetes incidence.\nThis shows olives nutrition has the potential to treat obesity naturally.\n(15) Many studies show how effective olives are in fighting off certain microbial, viral and fungal infections.\nOlives are a low-calorie snack option and great added ingredient to scores of dishes like salads, pastas and pizza.\nAs a high-sodium food, you might ask, “Are olives really good for you?” With a serving this large (100 grams), the sodium content is high (1,556 milligrams per 100 grams or 65 percent DV), and it can be high in many varieties because of the curing process.\nIt’s important to keep an eye on sodium content if and when that information is available, as some olives are cured differently than others.\nAlthough the fat content in olives is also high, it’s primarily “good fat.” Olives provide monounsaturated fatty acids, and more specifically oleic acid, which is linked with a number of health benefits like lowering inflammation and helping fight heart disease.\n(20) The fats found in olives and the Mediterranean diet are a great substitute for harmful fats.\nOlive fruit with the highest phenolic content include Cornicabra, Coratina, Moraiolo and Koroneiki.\nBlack olives, which have the highest oil content but the lowest phenolic levels, typically come in cans and are a popular toppings for pizzas and dips.\nIf the information is available, it’s important to keep an eye on sodium levels, as some olives have higher sodium levels due to processing."

        "1": "Citrus fruits are a terrific source, but oranges (with a medium-size orange coming in at about 62 calories) also provide a number of other protective nutrients.\nFoods can provide 20% of your daily fluid needs, and water-rich foods like oranges contribute even more to the daily requirement.\nConsuming enough daily fluid helps support mental and physical energy, improve circulation, optimize organ function, flush out waste, and maximize metabolism.\nThe fiber in oranges supports digestive function, helps regulate blood sugar and insulin levels, boosts feelings of fullness, and can even contribute to healthy sleep.\nThis type of fiber has been shown to help reduce blood cholesterol and fend off internal belly fat called visceral fat.\nOne study that tracked adults over five years found that for each 10-gram increase in soluble fiber consumed, the rate of visceral belly fat accumulation decreased by 3.7%.\nThat’s significant: Carrying more visceral fat is linked to increased inflammation and a greater risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and some cancers.\nIn addition to supporting immune function, this key nutrient helps produce collagen, reduce inflammation, and boost the body's ability to use fat as a fuel source, both during exercise and at rest.\nA higher flavonoid intake is also linked to the prevention of weight gain and reduced body fat.\nHealth-protective nutrients aren’t only found in oranges and orange juice; they’re also in the peel.\nResearch shows that flavonoids in citrus peels may help prevent the reproduction, growth, and spread of cancer cells, as well as support apoptosis, the self-destruct sequence the body uses to kill off dysfunctional cells.\nOne older University of Arizona study concluded that eating one tablespoon of citrus zest per week may reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer by 30%.\nWhile whole oranges are more filling and provide more fiber, juice can count as part of your daily fruit intake.\nOne study found that a higher intake of citrus juice was linked to improvements in cognitive function in older adults.\nAnother found that flavanone-rich citrus juice in quantities commonly consumed can enhance blood flow to the brain in healthy, young adults.",
        "2": "We’ve all heard the saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.” But with all of the antioxidants, micronutrients and health-promoting properties crammed inside the orange, it’s safe to say that oranges may be just as effective in keeping you healthy.\nIn fact, the orange nutrition profile contains a good chunk of the fiber, vitamin C, folate, thiamine and potassium that you need in the entire day.\nEating oranges — along with using orange oil — has been associated with numerous health benefits, from reducing the risk of heart disease to fighting cancer.\nWith the many varieties of oranges available from kumquats to clementines to cara caras and beyond, there are plenty of ways to enjoy this delicious citrus fruit and get the benefits of orange nutrition.\nOranges are low in calories but contain a good amount of fiber and vitamin C as well as a range of other important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\nOrange juice nutrition, on the other hand, is higher in calories and sugar, plus lower in fiber.\nCitrus fruits like oranges are packed with health-promoting antioxidants.\nAntioxidants are believed to play a role in the development of conditions like heart disease, cancer and diabetes.\n(3) In particular, oranges are high in bioflavonoids like hesperidin and hesperetin, which have been shown in test-tube studies to help neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation and decrease oxidative damage to cells.\nOne review published in the Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism showed that getting enough vitamin C could help reduce symptoms and shorten the duration of respiratory tract infections like the common cold.\n(5) Thanks to their high antioxidant content, some research indicates that getting your daily dose of oranges could help protect against and prevent the development of cancer.\nIn fact, eating more citrus fruit has been associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer.\nOne study in Korea, for example, found that having a high intake of citrus fruits was associated with a 10 percent reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer.\n(6) Other research has found similar inverse associations between citrus fruit intake and the risk of other types of cancer, including esophageal, pancreatic, stomach and  prostate cancer.\nMultiple studies have found that upping your intake of citrus fruits like oranges could do everything from improve your cholesterol levels to protect against coronary heart disease.\n(13) Similarly, another study published in the Journal of Epidemiology showed that frequent consumption of citrus fruits was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nA study in the British Journal of Nutrition even found that a higher intake of citrus fruits was linked to improvements in cognitive function among older adults.\n(17, 18) As a common ingredient in many skin care products, it’s no secret that the orange fruit benefits for skin are pretty impressive.\nIn fact, some research shows that certain types of oranges may even been be able to help fight and reverse skin aging.\nIn one test-tube study, tangerine peels were shown to have anti-aging, anti-wrinkle properties thanks to their antioxidant content.\n(19) Another study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology showed that supplementation with an extract from blood oranges helped protect against UV-induced skin damage and decreased age spot pigmentation by 20 percent.\none medium orange, for example, oranges contain less calories and fiber but are higher in vitamin C, folate, thiamine and potassium.\nApple consumption has been associated with numerous health benefits, and studies show that apples may protect against conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes and even asthma.\n(21) While there may be some distinct differences between apples and oranges, each brings a unique set of nutrients and health benefits to the table and can make a positive addition to your diet.\nSailors were often encouraged to drink orange and lemon juice to help prevent scurvy and citrus trees were even planted along trade routes.\nWhile orange nutrition benefits are pretty impressive, it’s important to remember that the same benefits may not extend to orange juice.\nThis is because oranges contain a good amount of fiber, which helps slow the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream.\nOrange juice, on the other hand, provides a concentrated amount of the sugar found in oranges, without any of the beneficial fiber.\nAlthough rare, some people may be allergic to citrus fruits like oranges."

        "1": "In this article, we examine the health benefits (and some potential side effects) of oysters alongside their full nutrition profile.\nOysters provide various health benefits, and they are particularly good for their vitamin B12, omega-3, and mineral content.\nIn this next section, we will look at some of the numerous benefits that oyster intake can provide.\nAlthough not commonly referred to when discussing the benefits of omega-3, oysters offer a good source.\nPer 100 grams, oysters provide around 672 mg of omega-3 fatty acids (1).\nOne hundred grams of oysters only offer seven grams of protein, but it is the per-calorie protein ratio that is particularly impressive.\nOn this note, oysters offer this seven grams of protein for only 68 calories, which rivals lean red meat for protein density (1).\nOysters offer a surprising amount of zinc, and they are the world’s best dietary source of the mineral.\nOne hundred grams of oysters provide an impressive 491% of the reference daily intake (RDI) for zinc.\nFor instance, we can get 320 IU of vitamin D from 100 grams of oysters, which represents approximately 80% of the RDI (1).\nTherefore, oysters are a great potential source of the vitamin for people who don’t get enough sun exposure, or for individuals living in countries with long and dark winters.\nHowever, oysters offer far more of this nutrient than any typical meat, and only organ meats like liver can rival their B12 content.\nThe table below shows how oysters compare to meat and organ meats for vitamin B12 content, per 100 grams raw (1, 10, 11, 12).\nWhile oysters don’t offer as much B12 as liver, they are among the very best dietary sources of the vitamin.\nOysters are rich in copper, and they contain 4.5 mg of the mineral per 100 grams, which works out at 223% of the RDI (1).\nOnce again, except for organ meats, oysters are the top dietary source of copper.\nFirstly, oysters are very high in zinc, which appears to play an essential role in cellular structure and maintaining optimal cardiovascular function (14, 15).\nOmega-3, also contained in oysters, may help to lower several risk factors for cardiovascular disease by decreasing triglycerides and improving HDL levels (17).\nSince oysters contain almost 500% of the RDI for zinc per 100 grams, they will certainly boost zinc status in individuals with low levels.\nOne hundred grams provides many multiples of the RDI for numerous essential vitamins and minerals.\nIn addition to Vibriosis, raw oysters can be a risk factor for certain other types of foodborne illnesses.\nThe tables below show the complete nutrition profile for oysters per 100 grams raw (1).\nOysters offer an outstanding nutrition profile which is only really rivaled by organ meats.\nWith such a large amount of B12, vitamin D, selenium, copper and zinc, including oysters in our diet can offer numerous benefits.",
        "2": "This article reviews the impressive health benefits — but also risks — of eating oysters and explains the best ways to prepare them.\nIn fact, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of wild eastern oysters provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Oysters are low in calories yet loaded with nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.\nPeople who eat diets high in omega-3 fats have a lower risk of developing conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\nOysters are packed with essential nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.\nThey’re especially high in the following vitamins and minerals: Aside from their other various roles in health, many of these nutrients offer antioxidant protection as well.\nWhat’s more, zinc and vitamins B12 and D also have antioxidant effects, boosting the protective benefits of oysters even higher (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).\nResearch shows that people who eat diets rich in antioxidants lower their risk of heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nFor example, a review of nine studies demonstrated that high-protein diets significantly reduced levels of hemoglobin A1c — a marker of long-term blood sugar control — in adults with type 2 diabetes (21Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, high-protein diets may reduce heart disease risk factors in those with type 2 diabetes.\nA review of 18 studies in people with type 2 diabetes found that high-protein diets significantly reduced triglyceride levels — a major risk factor for heart disease (22Trusted Source).\nHigh-protein diets that include oysters may promote weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and reduce heart disease risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.\nAside from being packed with beneficial nutrients like vitamins, oysters also contain a recently discovered, unique antioxidant called 3,5-Dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA).\nIn fact, a test-tube study showed that it was 15 times more powerful in fighting oxidative stress than Trolox, a synthetic form of vitamin E commonly used to prevent damage caused by oxidative stress (23Trusted Source).\nSome test-tube studies indicate that DHMBA from oysters may be of particular benefit to liver health.\nFor example, one test-tube study demonstrated that it protected human liver cells from damage and cell death caused by induced oxidative stress (24Trusted Source).\nScientists are hopeful that DHMBA may be useful in preventing or treating liver diseases in the future, but research is limited to test-tube studies at this time (25Trusted Source).\nThough it’s clear that oysters offer impressive health benefits, some potential concerns exist — especially when consuming them raw.\nEating raw oyster meat poses a greater risk of bacterial infection.\nOysters can also carry Norwalk-type viruses and enteroviruses that can pose health risks (30Trusted Source).\nDue to these potential health risks, children, those with compromised immune systems, and pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid eating raw seafood (32Trusted Source, 33, 34).\nBecause they can pose a health risk, eat raw oysters with caution.\nThey’re packed with high-quality protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants — all of which benefit health.\nStill, raw oysters can contain potentially harmful bacteria, so enjoy them cooked to avoid infection.\nThis article reviews different types of shellfish, their… Vitamin D is essential for health, but it can be hard to get enough of it from your diet."

        "2": "Peaches are a valuable source of nutrition, and peach nutrition helps your body fight free radicals, prevent cancer and protect your heart from disease.\nPeaches are high-antioxidant foods that have anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties, which is why peach nutrition offers a slew of impressive health benefits.\nThe peach is known officially as Prunus persica, earning its unique name from the journey it took from its location of origin, China, through Persia via the Silk Road to Europe.\nBoth common peach types can be cultivated with a white or yellow peel, each of which has flecks or lines of red in the skin.\nOne of the greatest qualities in peach nutrition is the high quantity of antioxidants found in these delicious fruits.\nPeaches display strong antioxidant properties that have long-term implications for fighting disease and ridding the body of free radicals.\nIn fact, many fruit juices (including freshly squeezed peach juice) begin the process of relieving oxidative stress in just 30 minutes after you consume them.\n(2) As with many types of food, the specific variety of peach determines the exact antioxidant load.\n(4) Caffeic acid is an antioxidant specifically found in high levels in peach nutrition.\n(6) Considering the mountain of evidence linking aflatoxin with cancer, the presence of caffeic acid in peaches is an especially important reason to eat them regularly.\nLike so many whole, fresh foods, peaches have been strongly linked to the prevention and regression of various cancers, placing them among some of the best cancer-fighting foods around.\nAccording to a 2014 study by researchers at Texas A&M, polyphenols in peaches (and plums) successfully inhibited the growth and metastasis (spreading to other organs) of at least one strain of breast cancer cells.\nThey recommend breast cancer patients eat two to three peaches a day to experience the same cancer-protective effects.\n(8) Caffeic acid, the antioxidant found so richly in peaches, can inhibit a type of fibrocarcinoma, a tumor that grows in fibrous connective tissue.\n(9) Certain colon cancers are also stunted in their growth by the consumption of peaches and similar fruits.\nIn traditional Asian medicine, the seed of the peach has been used for millennia in the treatment of many diseases.\nIn 2003, scientists found that the compounds in peach seeds reduce the growth of papilloma (tumors) on the skin and slow their carcinogenesis, the process by which benign tumors develop into cancer.\nPeach flower extract, through antioxidation, protects your skin from UV damage and the development of skin cancer.\n(11) While I don’t recommend chemotherapy treatments for cancer until all natural options have been exhausted, peach nutrition also offers help alongside the use of the common chemotherapy drug cisplatin.\nWhen cisplatin is administered alongside peach skin, however, the degree to which the liver was damaged was drastically reduced in one 2008 study in Korea.\nHowever, peaches (along with plums and apricots) offer hope for the occurrence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.\nThese “stone fruits,” termed as such because of their large inner seed shells, have proved to have a unique combination of bioactive compounds that, together, create drastic improvement in individuals at risk for heart disease.\nWhile all of the antioxidants, anti-inflammatory nutrients, and other vitamins and minerals in peaches may be found in other foods, researchers believe the fusion of the specific levels of these nutrients is what makes them so special.\n(13) One study examined the effect of replacing sugary drinks with natural fruit juices high in polyphenols and found it had a significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n(14) One study of over 1,300 people in China tested the effect of higher bioflavonoid consumption from fruits, including peaches, and found that, especially in women, the subjects’ lipid profiles all showed improvement.\nBecause inflammation is at the root of most diseases, it’s also helpful to know that peaches and other fruits like it help decrease inflammation levels in the body.\n(16) Fresh pulp and peel from peaches have serious fighting power against inflammation that causes cell death in the body, making peaches excellent anti-inflammatory foods.\nNot only does the extract of peach flowers protect against certain cancers, but it’s also a reasonable treatment for certain gut disorders known as motility disorders.\nPeach nutrition fights and eliminates the growth of candida fungus with its combination of polyphenols, bioflavonoids and condensed tannins.\n(18) Because they contain the powerful antioxidants like lutein, peaches also help to protect your eyes and keep them healthy.\n(19) In addition to its many vitamins and minerals, low calorie content and, of course, delicious flavor, the peach also comes packed with great antioxidants, including all five classifications of carotenoids.\nAs a great source of vitamin A and vitamin C, plus beneficial fiber, it’s no wonder peaches are such a wonder fruit when it comes to maintaining optimal health and fighting disease.\nPeach seeds have been used for many centuries as a part of Chinese medicine to treat various conditions, such as blood stasis, inflammation and allergies.\nCanned peaches lose about 21 percent of their antioxidant load.\nSome research indicates that peach seeds in particular have fairly impressive health benefits, but again, further research is needed.\nIt’s one of the most popular ways to eat peaches, and for good reason.\nAs a fruit, peaches probably should be consumed earlier in the day rather than later because of the way the sugar content in them is processed.\n(24) I also mentioned before that there are trace amounts of cyanide in peach seeds."

        "2": "The peanut plant likely originated in South America in Brazil or Peru.\nMany people believe the peanut is not as nutritionally valuable as true nuts like almonds, walnuts, or cashews.\nBut actually, peanuts have many of the same health benefits as the more expensive nuts and should not be overlooked as a nutritious food.\nBut research suggests that peanuts are every bit as good for heart health as more expensive nuts.\nPeanuts help prevent heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels.\nAnd among nuts, peanuts are second only to almonds when it comes to protein count.\nEating peanuts might help you live longer too.\nA large-scale study found that people who regularly ate any kind of nuts (including peanuts) were less likely to die of any cause than were people who rarely ate nuts.\nBecause the study was observational, it cannot prove that peanuts were exactly what caused the lower death rates, but they are definitely associated with them.\nPeanuts are a low-glycemic food, which means that eating them won’t cause a spike in your blood sugar levels.\nStudies have shown that eating peanuts can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.\nResearch has demonstrated that for older people, eating peanut butter may help lower the risk of developing a certain type of stomach cancer called gastric non cardia adenocarcinoma.\nWhile peanuts may have a large amount of fat, most of the fats they contain are known as “good fats.” These kinds of fats actually help lower your cholesterol levels.\n● Add peanut butter to hummus."

        "1": "(1) That’s a good thing, considering the wonderful benefits pear nutrition provides.\nFor instance, pears have the ability to fight chronic diseases by supplying high levels of antioxidants.\nStudies regarding pear nutrition have linked the fruit’s consumption with lower levels of constipation, kidney stones, high cholesterol and even diabetes.\nThey provide high amounts of vitamin C, vitamin K and boron, which aid in bone health, and pear nutrition also helps reverse copper deficiency and low potassium.\nThey are considered a pomaceous fruit that grow on a number of different pear trees.\nDifferent types of pears have similar health benefits, including their high fiber content, vitamin C and antioxidants.\nThis is why it’s a good idea to eat pears with their skins/peels on.\nPears are a bit more calorie-dense than berries, stone fruit like nectarines or peaches, or melon such as cantaloupe, but they are still a low-calorie food overall.\nAlthough pears and other fruits or vegetables do contain natural sugars in the form of the fructose, studies show that higher fruit and vegetable intake is inversely associated with diabetes incidence, especially among women.\nIf you’re concerned about consuming too much sugar — for example because you follow the ketogenic diet or a low-carb diet — but you still want to include fruit in your diet for the fiber, consider having half an avocado daily.\nAvocado is another high-fiber fruit but contains much less carbs and sugar (and much more healthy fat!).\nOne reason is because pears provide a good dose of the daily vitamin C you need.\nOne fresh, medium-sized pear contains about 10 percent to 12 percent of the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid).\nYes, pear nutrition benefits your skin due to its vitamin C content.\nConsuming vitamin C from high-antioxidant foods like pears helps increase skin’s immunity.\nEating pears is a great way to make sure you cover your bases of 25–30 grams of fiber daily.\nOne of the most researched aspects of pear nutrition is pears’ compound called pectin fiber.\nPectin fiber is more than just a regulator; it’s a type of special beneficial fiber that’s water-soluble and helps lower cholesterol and increases digestive health.\nIn addition to vitamin C, pear skins (or peels) also contain important phytonutrients.\nThese are mostly found in the skin of pears and can help ward off disease formation, so don’t peel your fruit!\nIn fact, when researchers studied the antioxidant capacity of pears and apples, they found that diets that included the fruit peels had a significantly higher level of healthy fatty acids (higher plasma lipid levels) and antioxidant activity than diets that discarded the peels and only ate the fruit’s pulp.\n(7) Diets high in fresh fruit, including pears, have also gained a lot of attention for having anti-inflammatory and cancer-protective effects.\nThose essential nutrients and antioxidants make pears one of the better anti-inflammatory foods around.\nAnother important way pear nutrition benefits you?\nAccording to studies by the National Cancer Institute, consuming fresh fruit daily shows positive effects on the body’s ability to prevent cancer growth, reduce inflammation, remain in pH balance, decrease oxidative damage to lipids and improve antioxidant status in healthy humans.\nOver and over we see that the more fresh vegetables and fruit someone eats, the less likely she is to gain weight and struggle to maintain her health.\n(9) Longitudinal studies among overweight adults find that a high-fiber diet coming from fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with slower weight gain.\nOne of the most noteworthy pear nutrition benefits is that pears can protect your heart by providing antioxidants, vitamins and fiber.\nThe beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables are probably due to the presence of antioxidant phytochemicals that keep arteries clear, lower inflammation and prevent high levels of oxidative stress.\n(10) We also know that the specific type of fiber found in pears called pectin is very useful in helping lower cholesterol levels naturally.\nThis supports the general health recommendation to consume multiple servings of fruits and vegetables (ideally five to nine a day of different types).\nAs a high-fiber food that provides essential nutrients, eating more pears is a great way to prevent or treat digestive issues.\nThis means either eating whole pears (including the skin), blending them into a smoothie or drinking pear juice can help regulate bowel movements, prevent water retention and decrease bloating.\nThe phytonutrients found in pears and other fruit protect the digestive organs from oxidative stress.\nResearchers now know that certain flavonoids in fruits, including pears, can improve insulin sensitivity.\nAfter following over 9,600 adults ages 25–74 for about 20 years, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that eating five or more servings of combined fruits and vegetables daily significantly cut the risk of diabetes formation.\n(13) Pears are considered a fruit low on the glycemic index.\nBecause of the high fiber content in pears, they unleash sugar into the bloodstream slowly and therefore have a low glycemic load.\nLike all fruit, eating pears can provide you with a quick boost of energy before a workout.\nPears are a good source of two nutrients that are key to skeletal health: vitamin K and boron.\nEven centuries ago, populations knew that pear nutrition benefited digestive health and could be used to promote “regularity,” fight dehydration and even reduce fevers.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, it’s recommended that fruits, including pears, be eaten when they are ripe and in season.\nBenefits of pears according to TCM include clearing coughs, improving breathing, reducing constipation and moisturizing the skin.\n(15) Pears are recommended either baked or eaten fresh, depending on the climate and how well they are digested.\nThe juice of pears is a great way to sweeten smoothies and recipes without adding refined sugar.\nBecause pears are high in fiber, it’s best to introduce them to your diet slowly if you currently don’t eat much fiber.\nWhile they all differ a bit in terms of taste and appearance, pear nutrition benefits for all types are pretty similar.\nWhat are potential side effects of eating pears?\nPears are often recommended by health care practitioners because they’re considered a hypoallergenic fruit.\nCan you eat too many pears?\nAlthough pears have multiple benefits, as with all fruit they do contain sugar.\nInclude pears as part of a diet that’s also filled with plenty of vegetables, healthy fats and proteins.\nPlan to eat pears (and all fruit) in moderation balanced by other low-sugar foods.",
        "2": "The proven health benefits of pears may include their ability to aid in weight loss, improve digestion, boost heart health, and can help regulate blood pressure.\nPears are a low-cal, high-fiber fruit favored in weight management programs.\nPears also contain active and effective components including potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, phenolic compounds, folate, dietary fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium, as well as B-complex vitamins.\nA 2015 study suggested that the phenolic content in the peel of Bartlett and Starkrimson pears and fermented pear juice may play a vital role in promoting gut health.\n[4] A study published in Nutrition Today led by Dr. Joanne Slavin, who is a professor at the University of Minnesota, concludes that fruits like pears are extremely great sources of dietary fiber.\n[5] While a single serving of pears provides 18% of the daily requirement for fiber intake, they can be a very strong agent for improving digestive health too.\n[6]  Like many other fruits, pears are a wealth of antioxidants like vitamin C that combat various diseases and conditions within the body.\nA 2003 research study on the antioxidant activity of pear has revealed that pear fruits may contain a remarkable amount of vitamin C and chlorogenic acid.\nAntioxidant components of vitamin C, vitamin A, and flavonoid compounds like beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, all of which are found in pears can help rid the body of free radicals.\n[8] The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published a comprehensive study suggesting the benefits of vitamin C above the recommended daily intake for health benefits like boosting immunity.\nPears are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C can be beneficial for stimulating white blood cell production.\n[9] A 2019 study published in the Current Developments in Nutrition journal showed a positive link between eating apples, pears, or combining apples and pears with a decreased risk of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases such as coronary disease and diabetes.\nNotably, among the fruit and vegetable categories, apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables were linked with decreased risk of stroke.\nThe antioxidant and flavonoid components of the fruit can induce anti-inflammatory effects in the body, reducing the pain and swelling associated with inflammation.\n[12] Word of Caution: There are no known interactions or health risks with the fruit.\nHowever, if you have an allergy to pears or other fruits, be mindful before enjoying them.\nHealth benefits of apple cider vinegar include its ability to regulate blood sugar levels, boost weight loss, improve skin & gut health, & lower cholesterol levels.Read more!\nThe powerful health benefits of dates include providing an energy boost, increasing iron in the body, and aiding digestion.\nGinger also helps boost bone health, strengthen the immune system, and increase appetite.\nBenefits of calamansi juice include bleaching the skin, detoxifying the body, aiding in weight loss & managing diabetes.\nThey improve digestion & heart health, boost immunity, slow aging, and aid in weight loss."

Dearest Adrian, Grist thanks its sponsors.\nCrunchy, healthy nuts plus chewy, healthy dried fruit plus … oh, I believe you’ve forgotten the most important ingredient in any trail mix: chocolate, of course!\nWe’ve dealt quite a bit with almonds and their water requirements here at Grist, and walnuts and pistachios raise the same issues, so for now let’s skip those.\nI’m not going to tell you to stop eating them altogether – it’s complicated, like most food issues – but it’s good to consider their water footprints all the same.\nPeanuts are packed with healthy fats too, and their sat fat levels are on par with other nuts, like pecans, cashews, and walnuts.\n(Of course, peanuts are technically legumes – but let’s not get too nutty with our sorting here.) And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation’s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in – wait for it – Brazil’s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don’t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou’ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you’re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to give you plenty of permutations for your trail mix, so I do hope you find some recipes to your liking.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate, justice, and solutions.\nYour support helps Grist reveal the under-reported connection between social justice and climate change.",

        "1": "Assuming they are not in a pie, these nuts also offer some interesting potential health benefits.\nThis article takes a full look at the nutrition profile of pecans as well as the benefits that they provide.\nNutritionally, pecans are predominantly a source of fat, but they also provide smaller amounts of carbohydrate and protein.\nHere we can see the full nutritional values for pecans, including the calories, macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals.\nTheir overall vitamin-density is not high, but pecans are a significant source of minerals.\nThis mineral profile is somewhat similar to the nutritional values of pine nuts.\nThe most abundant mineral in pecan nuts is manganese, and this nutrient is vital for maintaining healthy bones, optimal skeletal health, and wound healing (11).\nAlthough we do not fully understand how they work at this point, numerous randomized clinical trials have shown benefits from a high-flavonoid intake.\nA recent review paper showed how this compound is likely responsible for many of the health benefits pecans demonstrate in clinical trials (16).\nFirstly, it is important to note that no single food can singlehandedly control blood sugar and insulin levels.\nOver the past two years, two interesting trials examined the effect of pecans on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, specifically focusing on blood glucose and insulin levels.\nInterestingly, after four weeks of following the pecan plan, key markers of cardiovascular risk such as blood glucose levels and insulin resistance improved compared to the control diet (17).\nIn a 12-week study, 15% of calories from pecans per day improved cardiovascular risk compared to an eating plan based on the average American diet (18).\nEither way, compared to a standard American diet, a diet that includes a high intake of pecans improved the cardiovascular risk profile.\nFor a similar reason, pecans are a suitable snack for people with diabetes trying to control their blood glucose levels (19).\nFiber also slows digestion, and studies demonstrate that it can reduce postprandial blood glucose levels.\nAs a result, a higher fiber intake will help to reduce the blood glucose response from meals higher in carbohydrate (20).\nAs just mentioned, pecans are suitable food for anyone trying to control their blood sugar levels.\nA recent study looked into this issue, and when nuts replace dietary carbohydrate, the results appear to be positive.\nOverall, the results demonstrated that replacing carbohydrate with nuts improved glycemic response and lowered HbA1c levels.\nFurthermore, as previously discussed, diets including a high daily intake of pecans lead to better blood glucose levels than standard American diets (17).\nAlthough it is not a significant amount compared to other foods, pecans also provide a source of protein.\nOverall, pecans offer a good nutrient profile, more polyphenols than any other nut, and they may help to improve blood glucose levels.",
        "2": "Just a single ounce of pecans (about 19 halves) is 200 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 20 grams of mostly unsaturated fats, making it a hearty, satisfying snack with loads of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.\nWhat's more, eating ellagic acid-containing foods — an antioxidant found in pecans — is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers.\nAnother benefit to these tasty tree nuts: Pecans are filled with beta carotene and vitamin E, which protect cells from damage by mitigating the effects of chronic inflammation.\nIt may not be news to you that nuts are some of the most nutritious foods, but chew on this: Diets high in vitamin E have been linked with lowering risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia by up to 25%.\nThat's because vitamin E and other antioxidants in plant-based foods help reduce oxidative stress caused by inflammation, protecting cells and therefore tissues of vital organs like your brain.\nThat's because nuts are a filling source of oleic acid, a better-for-you fat that makes you feel full while also boosting heart health.\nEating every three to four hours, limiting added sugars and saturated fats found in processed foods, and making more of your meals plant-based are also key to successful, long-term weight loss.\nPecans are excellent sources of manganese and copper, two minerals that boost overall metabolic health, may contain anti-inflammatory properties, and potentially help reduce risk of heart disease.\nDiets high in sodium have been linked to increased risk of chronic disease, especially high blood pressure."

        "2": "We all know pineapple as a delicious tropical fruit that garnishes our drinks, but did you know that it also provides a good dose of vitamin C, vitamin B1, potassium and manganese, in addition to other special compounds and antioxidants that help prevent disease formation?\nBenefits of pineapple include protecting against cardiovascular disease, improving fertility and reducing inflammation.\nMuch of the healing power of this fruit comes from a protein-digesting enzyme called bromelain.\nA pineapple fruit can weigh up to eight pounds and produces fruit that is both sweet and tart, containing fiber-like pectin that gives the fruit its chewy texture.\nBecause of the many health benefits of pineapple, the fruit quickly became popular on ships since it offers natural prevention against scurvy, a common health issue at the time.\nThis enzyme may help speed healing and acts as an anti-inflammatory medication, similarly to over-the-counter medications like aspirin and ibuprofen.\nAdditionally when applied topically, the benefits of bromelain include its ability to help in healing cuts, burns, insect bites, and to help dissipate bruising and other skin problems.\nRecent studies also show that bromelain helps stop lung metastasis in its tracks, which suggests that it can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases.\nBecause of the vitamin C content in it, this amazing fruit can help your body fight off free radical damage and reduce inflammation, which are known to contribute to the development of cancer.\nFruits that are high in fiber may help to lower your risk of colorectal cancer.\nBecause of its high fiber content and volume, one of the benefits of pineapple is that it can help to make you feel full with little calories.\nAccording to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, studies show that eating foods that are rich in antioxidants can help prevent infertility.\nBecause free radicals can damage the reproductive system, foods with high antioxidant activity like pineapples are recommended for people who are trying to conceive.\nIn terms of pineapple benefits for men, antioxidants have been shown to help increase blood flow and restore proper tissue formation in the genital organs — plus they can assist in boosting sperm count.\nSimilarly, benefits of eating pineapple for a woman include reducing inflammation and supporting connective tissue healing.\nThe benefits of pineapple extend to heart health because of its fiber, potassium, vitamin C and antioxidant content.\nOne study conducted on rats found that one of the benefits of pineapple juice is that it has cardioprotective abilities.\nThe study concluded that pineapple juice can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and help establish digestion and absorption.\nFruits that are high in potassium can also help lower high blood pressure.\nPineapples also help improve heart health because of the effects of powerful bromelain, which can fight blood clotting and is nature’s answer to those taking an aspirin a day to lower the risk of heart attack.\nThe beta-carotene that is found in plant foods like pineapples may help to lower the risk of respiratory inflammation and asthma.\nAll of these factors cause inflammation, but luckily one of the benefits of pineapple is that it can help reduce inflammation through its detoxifying capabilities.\nAnother one of the benefits of pineapple is that its nutrients may help improve your mood and fight depression and anxiety.\nThe benefits of pineapple include the ability to help those suffering from arthritis and joint pain.\nA study done at Duke University Medical Center that was conducted on 100 mice who suffered from colitis (inflammation of the colon) showed that long-term dietary supplementation with fresh or unpasteurized frozen pineapple juice with active bromelain enzymes is safe and effectively decreases inflammation severity.\nThe study showed that the bromelain found in pineapples caused a significantly faster recovery than standard therapy.\nFor digestion, eating pineapple serves as a powerful aid in breaking down proteins into peptides and amino acids.\nWhile it doesn’t typically have laxative effects, it provides fiber, water and electrolytes (like most fruits and veggies do) that can aid in regularity.\nBromelain also seems useful in helping prevent autoimmune responses due to common food allergies.\nStudies have found evidence that eating pineapple may help those who had celiac disease, an allergy to the protein gluten that is found in wheat, barley and rye products, due to the presence of the bromelain enzyme.\nTo get the benefits of pineapple in your diet, you can eat it by itself as a snack, or you can add it to both sweet and savory dishes.\nHowever, if the acid in pineapples gives you a stomachache when you eat it alone, try having it with a bigger meal, including one that provides some protein and fat.\nPineapple itself is hydrating, since it contains a lot of water (like all fruit).\nHowever, drinking water with high-fiber foods is a good idea for improving digestion.\nKeep in mind that, as mentioned above, eating lots of fresh pineapple or drinking pineapple juice will not effectively provide a sufficient dose of treatment because most of the bromelain is found in the core and stem of the fruit.\nOne of the easiest ways to benefit from pineapple and fresh pineapple juice is to add some to a vitamin-packed smoothie.\nIt is not a commonly allergenic fruit, and because of the bromelain, it actually helps with digestion.\nThe bromelain that is found in pineapple may interact with some medications, and this is something that you can mention to your health care provider."

        "1": "These edible seeds of the Pistacia vera tree contain healthy fats and are a good source of protein, fiber, and antioxidants.\nWhat’s more, they contain several essential nutrients and can aid weight loss and heart and gut health.\nAmong nuts, pistachios have the highest content of lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which are very important antioxidants for eye health (6Trusted Source, 7).\nWhile eating nuts has many health benefits, they’re typically high in calories.\nThey also have a higher ratio of essential amino acids ⁠— the building blocks of protein ⁠— than any other nut (10Trusted Source).\nIt’s converted into nitric oxide in your body, which is a compound that causes your blood vessels to dilate, aiding blood flow (6Trusted Source).\nPistachios are rich in fiber and protein, both of which increase feelings of fullness and help you eat less (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nIn one 12-week weight loss program, those who ate 1.9 ounces (53 grams) of pistachios per day as an afternoon snack had twice the reduction in body mass index, compared with those who ate 2 ounces (56 grams) of pretzels per day (16Trusted Source).\nMoreover, another 24-week study in individuals with excess weight showed that those who consumed 20% of calories from pistachios lost 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) more from their waistlines than those who did not eat pistachios (17Trusted Source).\nOne study showed that individuals who ate in-shell pistachios consumed 41% fewer calories than individuals who ate shelled pistachios (21Trusted Source).\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Pistachios are high in fiber, with one serving containing 3 grams (2Trusted Source).\nGut bacteria then ferment the fiber and convert it into short-chain fatty acids, which may have several health benefits, including a reduced risk of developing digestive disorders, cancer, and heart disease (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nIn addition to being high in antioxidants, pistachios may lower blood cholesterol and improve blood pressure, thus lowering your risk of heart disease (6Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nUp to 67% of these studies have shown reductions in total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and increases in HDL (good) cholesterol (28Trusted Source).\nMeanwhile, none of these studies observed that eating pistachios harmed the blood lipid profile (28Trusted Source).\nOne 4-week study in people with high LDL cholesterol had participants consume 10% of their daily calories from pistachios.\nWhat’s more, a diet consisting of 20% of calories from pistachios lowered LDL cholesterol by 12% (25Trusted Source).\nA review of 21 studies found that eating pistachios reduced the upper limit of blood pressure by 1.82 mm/Hg and the lower limit by 0.8 mm/Hg (29Trusted Source).\nIt’s important that it works properly, as endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor for heart disease (30Trusted Source).\nIt causes blood vessels to dilate by signaling the smooth cells in the endothelium to relax (30Trusted Source).\nTherefore, these tiny nuts may play an important role in promoting blood vessel health.\nOne study in 42 patients who consumed 1.5 ounces (40 grams) of pistachios a day for 3 months showed improvements in markers of endothelial function and vascular stiffness (31Trusted Source).\nAnother 4-week study had 32 healthy young men consume a diet consisting of 20% of calories from pistachios.\nIt found that endothelium-dependent vasodilation improved by 30%, compared with when they followed a Mediterranean diet (26Trusted Source).\nIn one study, men with erectile dysfunction experienced a 50% improvement in parameters of erectile function after eating 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of pistachios a day for 3 weeks (27Trusted Source).\nPerhaps not surprisingly, studies have shown that eating pistachios can help promote healthy blood sugar levels.\nOne study showed that when 2 ounces (56 grams) of pistachios were added to a carb-rich diet, healthy individuals’ blood sugar response after a meal was reduced by 20–30% (6Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).\nIn another 12-week study, individuals with type 2 diabetes showed a 9% reduction in fasting blood sugar after eating 0.9 ounces (25 grams) of pistachios as a snack twice per day (33Trusted Source).\nIn addition to being rich in fiber and healthy fats, pistachio nuts are rich in antioxidants, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds, all of which are beneficial for blood sugar control (6Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).\nPistachios are a great source of healthy fats, fiber, protein, antioxidants, and various nutrients, including vitamin B6 and thiamine.\nTheir health effects may include weight loss benefits, lower cholesterol and blood sugar, and improved gut, eye, and blood vessel health.",
        "2": "They’re called nuts, but botanically pistachios are seeds.\nYou can buy pistachios shelled or unshelled, roasted, or salted.\nThey’re available in most grocery stores, and you can buy them in bulk from pistachio growers.\nPistachios are bursting with the fiber, minerals, and unsaturated fat that can help keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check.\nBuying pistachios in their shells slows down your eating.\nSome studies suggest that eating pistachios lowers the amount of fat and sugar (glycemic index) in your blood, as well as improves the flexibility and tone of your blood vessels.\nAlthough raw pistachios don’t have much sodium (1 cup has about 1 milligram), that’s not true for roasted pistachios, which are often salted.\nA cup of dry roasted pistachios with salt has 526 milligrams of sodium.\nPistachios can sometimes be tricky to eat since they have a tough shell.\nIf there’s a crack in the shell, you can use the shell of another pistachio to pry it open.\nGo nuts to lower your heart risk.” Harvard T.H.

        "2": "A pomegranate is a ruby-red fruit with juicy seeds—called arils—that can be added to salads, cocktails, and meat- or rice-based entrees.\nThis versatile fruit provides important vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and copper, along with a healthy dose of fiber.\nWhile it can be labor-intensive to free the arils from the flesh of the pomegranate, it's worth it for their bright flavor and antioxidants.\nThis nutrition information, for one medium pomegranate (3-3/8\" in diameter), is provided by the USDA.1﻿ Pomegranate calories come primarily from carbohydrates.\nYou'll get 21 grams of sugar if you consume a medium-sized fruit.\nAs expected, carb counts, sugars, and calories are different for pomegranate juice compared to the fruit.\nOne cup (8 oz) of 100% pomegranate juice provides 134 calories, 33 grams of carbohydrate, 31 grams of sugar, and 0 grams of fiber, according to USDA data.2﻿ Pomegranate juice cocktail (which is pomegranate juice blended with other fruit juices and added sugar) usually has more calories, carbs, and sugar than plain pomegranate juice.\nIt is considered to be more helpful than just using glycemic index for people who are choosing foods based on their effects on blood glucose.\nA medium-sized fruit provides 3 grams of protein.\nPomegranate juice, on the other hand, provides almost no protein (0.4 grams per cup).1﻿ Whole, fresh pomegranate contains important vitamins and minerals.\nThere is 16mg of vitamin C in a medium-sized fruit, which is about 18% recommended daily value based on a 2,000-calorie diet.\nA medium-sized pomegranate also contains 28% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin K for women and 21% for men.1﻿ Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps with blood clotting functions in the body.\nPomegranates are also a good source of folate (15% of RDA), copper (27% of RDA), thiamin (9% of RDA), vitamin B6 (9% of RDA), and potassium (10% of the recommended intake; potassium does not have an RDA).\nIf you drink pomegranate juice, you'll still benefit from vitamin K, folate, and (some) copper, but the juice provides almost no vitamin C, according to the USDA.2﻿ However, new products come out every day which may include vitamin C.\nPomegranate seeds and juice contain compounds and nutrients with health-promoting qualities.\nVitamin C must be consumed through the diet because our bodies are unable to make it.3﻿ According to the National Institutes of Health, \"ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role.\"3﻿ Pomegranates also contain other antioxidant compounds, such as quercetin and anthocyanins, which also work to repair cell damage caused by oxidative stress.4﻿ You'll get a healthy boost of fiber when you consume pomegranate arils (not juice).\nIf you are on medication, speak with your healthcare provider before including the fruit in your diet to stay safe.\nBecause pomegranate is rich in vitamin K, it may interfere with the blood clotting medicine Coumadin (warfarin).8﻿ But appropriate dietary levels of vitamin K vary, so discuss your diet with your doctor if you take this medicine.\nA fresh ripe pomegranate should feel heavy when it is ready to eat.\nPomegranates that have started to turn brown are likely past their prime, but abrasions to the fruit do not affect its quality (and you don't eat the skin anyway, so there's no need to discard the fruit if it has marks).9﻿ You can also purchase just the pomegranate arils (seeds) in the refrigerated or frozen section of some grocery stores, but they are often more expensive than purchasing the whole fruit.\nKeep your pomegranates intact (whole) until you are ready to eat the arils.\nHowever, the arils are only good for about three days once they are removed from the fruit.\nYou can often find containers of pomegranate arils, already removed from the fruit, for sale in the produce section; keep these in the refrigerator, too.\nPomegranate \"seeds\" are actually called arils.\nInside each aril is a white seed that you can either eat or spit out, although the seeds provide fiber.\nMost people prefer not to eat the skin or the white flesh that surrounds the arils.\nThere are several different ways to de-seed a pomegranate, but the simplest method is to simply cut the fruit into quarters and immerse the pieces in a large bowl of water.\nOnce you've got your pomegranate arils, sprinkle them in yogurt, on a salad, or into your sparkling water or eat them alone as a snack.\nAllergy to pomegranate and artichoke, novel food allergens of the Mediterranean diet."

and rich in many vitamins and minerals, lean pork can be an excellent addition to a healthy diet.\nPork is a high-protein food and contains varying amounts of fat.\nA 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of cooked, ground pork provides the following nutrients (1Trusted Source): Like all meat, pork is mostly made up of protein.\nFor this reason, eating pork — or other types of meat — may be particularly beneficial for bodybuilders, recovering athletes, people post-surgery, or others who need to build up or repair muscles.\nLike other types of red meat, pork is mainly composed of saturated fats and unsaturated fats — present in approximately equal amounts.\nFor example, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of cooked, ground pork packs about 7.7 grams of saturated, 9.3 grams of monounsaturated, and 1.9 grams of polyunsaturated fat (1Trusted Source).\nHigh-quality protein is the main nutritional component of pork, making it useful for muscle growth and maintenance.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Pork is high in various healthy vitamins and minerals, as well as high-quality protein.\nLike most animal foods, pork is an excellent source of high-quality protein.\nInadequate intake of high-quality protein may accelerate age-related muscle degeneration — increasing your risk of sarcopenia (14Trusted Source).\nEating pork — or other protein-rich foods — is an excellent way to ensure sufficient dietary intake of high-quality protein that may help preserve muscle mass.\nAside from being rich in high-quality protein, pork contains a variety of healthy nutrients that are beneficial for your muscles.\nIn fact, high levels of carnosine in human muscles have been linked to reduced fatigue and improved physical performance (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nFollowing vegetarian or vegan diets — which are low in beta-alanine — reduces the amount of carnosine in muscles over time (21Trusted Source).\nIn contrast, high dietary intake of beta-alanine — including from supplements — increases muscle carnosine levels (15Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\nAs a result, eating pork — or other rich sources of beta-alanine — may be beneficial for those who want to maximize their physical performance.\nPork is an excellent source of high-quality protein, so it should be effective for the growth and maintenance of muscle mass.\nLike other types of meat, it may also help improve muscle function and exercise performance.\nIt’s clear that a high meat intake is linked to unhealthy lifestyle factors, such as low consumption of fruit and vegetables, less physical activity, smoking, and overeating (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\nOne popular hypothesis links the cholesterol and saturated fat content of meat to an increased risk of heart disease.\nHowever, dietary cholesterol has little or no effect on cholesterol levels in most people and many scientists don’t consider it a health concern (13Trusted Source).\nModerate consumption of lean pork — as a part of a healthy diet — is unlikely to increase your risk of heart disease.\nMany observational studies note a link between red meat and colon cancer risk — although the evidence is not entirely consistent (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nStill, the idea that a high intake of meat causes cancer is plausible.\nOvercooked meat may contain a number of carcinogenic substances — most notably heterocyclic amines (39Trusted Source).\nHeterocyclic amines are a family of unhealthy substances found in relatively high amounts in well-done and overcooked meat, fish, or other sources of animal protein.\nStudies suggest that foods high in heterocyclic amines raise the risk of several types of cancer, such as of the colon, breast, and prostate (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source).\nIn the context of a healthy diet, moderate intake of adequately cooked pork probably does not increase your risk of cancer.\nHowever, high consumption of overcooked pork is a cause for concern.\nEating raw or undercooked (rare) pork should be avoided — especially in developing countries.\nThat’s because raw pork may contain several types of parasites that can infect humans (47Trusted Source).\nHowever, it may occasionally lead to a disease known as cysticercosis, estimated to affect approximately 50 million people each year (47Trusted Source).\nThough this condition is uncommon in developed countries, eating raw or undercooked (rare) pork may increase your risk — especially when the meat is from free-ranging, wild, or backyard pigs (47Trusted Source).\nIn developed countries, such as the United States, the most common cause of infection is the consumption of raw or undercooked pork (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source).\nIt’s a rich source of high-quality protein, as well as various vitamins and minerals.\nThough not exactly a health food, moderate consumption of properly prepared pork can be an acceptable part of a healthy diet.",

        "1": "It might be hard to believe, but there was once a time when most of the American public didn’t know what quinoa was, much less how to pronounce it (by the way, it’s pronounced keen-wa, for anyone still in the dark).\nIn recent years, human rights activists have raised concerns over whether the seed’s booming sales have adversely affected the Bolivian and Peruvian farmers that rely on quinoa as a staple in their own diets.\nAs a result of its popularity, the price of quinoa has skyrocketed in the countries where it is grown, and farmers are scrambling to grow enough to meet the demand.\nThe resulting production methods, besides causing increased poverty in these communities, have also had a strong effect on biodiversity and the environment.\nIn some ways, it’s quite simple: an increasing public demand for quinoa has led to a need for farmers to expand their lands to cultivate the protein-rich seed.\nHowever, as consumption has increased, farmers have expanded its area of cultivation, forcing out other crops grown in the region.\nIn Bolivia, quinoa production increased by 40 times from 2000 to 2009.\nNot only does quinoa grow at very high altitudes, but it relies on the natural manure produced by llamas in the region.\nAs farmers have expanded on more land, they have displaced llamas who traditionally provided natural fertilizer and prevented erosion, which has caused farmers to replace the manure.\nAnother concern relates to the increased incidence of insects where quinoa is grown.\nFinally, consider that with an increasing consumer demand, farmers can no longer harvest their crops by hand.\nQuinoa is a somewhat unique case, because, unlike other monoculture foods, which can be obtained locally or grown in your own background, this plant needs a very specific altitude and environment in which to thrive.\nThe main crop \"pushed out of production\" in the past 5 years has been coca.\nContrary to your claim that llamas provide the main source of fertilizer for these areas, guano is used far more.\nAlso, your claim that more insecticides are used is true, but it is in no way correlated to an increase in quinoa production.\nYou seem to applaud the hand work performed by farmers, but it is one of the main causes of poverty and subsistence agriculture.",
        "2": "This pseudo-cereal superfood stirs up debate – packed with nutrition and the potential to improve global food security – quinoa is shrouded in humanitarian and environmental issues.\nQuinoa was one of the grains that the government purchased from small farmers as part of this program.\nMore farmers began to expand their crop size and produce quinoa for government purchase when the ‘quinoa boom’ hit in 2009.\nThey claimed that the high quinoa prices, brought on by the boom, made it impossible for Andean farmers to afford it.\nThis meant modest farm families who once enjoyed a vitamin and mineral-rich superfood would now suffer from food insecurity.\nThere were rumors of land conflicts and loss of biodiversity as farmers turned to monocropping and abandoned traditional, sustainable farming practices to keep up with increased demand.\nWell-intentioned consumers concerned for Andean people and the environment slowed or stopped their quinoa consumption, dropping farmers’ sale prices from $4 per pound back to $0.60.\nThe claims being made were based on studies from Bolivia, not Peru, even though Peru is responsible for roughly 60% of global quinoa production and exportation.\nAgricultural economist Andrew Stevens, also studied the ENAHO survey and found that quinoa is simply one in 161 foods that make up many Peruvians’ diets.\nThe media scare that led to the quinoa bust got one thing right: The quinoa boom had negative effects on Peruvian farmlands and the environment.\nFarmers trying to keep up with demand and make more profit abandoned tradition.\nIndustrial harvesting and post-harvesting technologies have been introduced, reducing the use of sustainable, small-scale production.\nBecause quinoa production had not been a largely produced crop before the boom, quinoa-specific machinery had not been developed yet.\nCompanies, wanting to automate their processes, began to use technologies adapted from other crops, which led to problems with waste and inefficiency.\nThese solutions, although not as sustainable as traditional methods, reduce energy loss and greatly reduce harmful by-products.\nWalsh-Dilley, in her study on a community in Bolivia, notes a hopeful return to traditional practices, stating that producers in the area are abandoning tractors and returning to hand labor after seeing the negative consequences of automation on the land; land degradation and poor quality soil.\nMonocropping single-variety quinoa makes the crop more susceptible to pests and as a result, farmers are using more pesticides.\nAnd because quinoa farming has expanded, quinoa is being grown outside of its traditional areas where the crop is more vulnerable to disease and fungus.\nIt’s crucial that the government incentivize the use of traditional and responsible farming practices before production capacity drops to extremes.\nPart of what makes quinoa a future source for global food security lies in its diversity.\nHowever, due to the Global North’s preference for light-colored, large grains, farmers are demonstrating a tendency to produce much less variety.\nFurther, llamas often invade quinoa fields and destroy crops as a result of decreased territory and this, too, causes tension between farmers.\nMany llama farmers have abandoned llama farming and have turned to the more profitable quinoa production.\nThis has resulted in a decreased llama population; another example of biodiversity that’s at risk as a result of abandoning sustainable practices.\nThe argument is that Andean farmers need protection from unbalanced competition if developed countries, like the U.S., begin to cultivate and sell their own quinoa crops worldwide.\nIn fact, small farmers need protection from big business, not only abroad, but in their own countries.\nThe quinoa bust left small farmers without the financial means to compete in today’s market.\nLarge-scale Andean producers have the technology, capital and credit to increase yields and monopolize the market.\nWithout these traditions, the hope for quinoa as a sustainable food product could be lost.\nQuinoa has a lot of potential as a sustainable crop with the ability to make food more secure for vulnerable regions around the world.\nIncluding a high content of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and zinc.” As you can see from the nutrition facts, quinoa is a source of vitamins like riboflavin and folic acid.\nThe FAO of the UN has high hopes for using quinoa to aid its efforts to reduce global hunger and secure food for all.\nIn fact, the environment in Altiplano, Peru produces quinoa despite its harsh conditions like those listed above.\nAdditionally, quinoa can be produced at low costs and can offer poverty-stricken communities high nutritional value to fight malnutrition.\nA repeating theme in this article is that for quinoa to be sustainable, farmers, governments, cooperatives and quinoa companies must embrace traditional farming practices that respect crop rotation, biodiversity, land held in common and ‘rest’ periods for the land.\nWe know quinoa has the potential to be farmed sustainably because it already has been, and many small farmers continue to do so.\nProtein-rich plant foods like quinoa help us get the nutrition we need and reduce our meat consumption at the same time.\n“Therefore, quinoa saponin may be usedas an environmentally friendly alternative for protection of rice cultures against GAS.” According to Peruvian government figures, almost 40% of quinoa farmers are women who are usually inflexible to take other jobs because of their role as caregivers for children and the elderly.\nUndoubtedly, there’s a need for more research and resources to promote and maintain sustainable farming practices, while involving small farmers to avoid shutting them out of premium market prices.\nSmall farmers can form cooperatives and differentiate their quinoa as fair-trade and organic to compete with large farms.\nAlthough the quinoa boom did not come without its negative environmental and socio-economic side effects, this seedy grain superfood has the potential to not only reach sustainability status but also help those affected by climate change, in a sustainable way.\nIn fact, many small farmers in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador are already producing sustainable quinoa as we speak, using their traditional methods."

        "1": "The environmental effects of seasonal food supply have been explored through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of raspberries supplied to UK consumers at different times of year.\nSupply of raspberries at different times of the year draws on different production systems and locations.\nDespite that, the results of this LCA, based on data from individual producers, reveal relatively small differences in impacts for different times of supply, except in the case of the water footprint measures.\nSo in this case, yield and agricultural practice appear stronger drivers of the environmental burden of food production than is time of supply.",
        "2": "Raspberry production can be a good fit for small farms, as a small planting of raspberries can provide significant income and equipment needs are quite modest.\nRaspberry plantings should fruit for at least five years and occasionally produce for more than ten years.\nRaspberry plantings should fruit for at least five years and occasionally produce for more than ten years.\nInitial investment in a planting is relatively high, good management skills are needed to produce a quality product, and substantial labor is required.\nRed raspberries have chilling requirements that limit their production to cooler regions of the United States.\nUnder high-tunnel production, growers have the potential to produce higher yields and better quality fruit, but they must also consider the significant costs for the tunnel and higher level of management required.\nCanada is a major producer of red raspberries, with most of the production located in British Columbia and Ontario.\nSix basic marketing alternatives are available to the raspberry grower: wholesale markets, cooperatives, local retailers, roadside stands, pick-your-own operations, and processing firms.\nBecause raspberries are so perishable, they are well suited to marketing channels where a short period of time is spent in the \"pipeline\" from the producer to the consumer, such as roadside stands and pick-your-own operations.\nRecently, however, there has been an increased interest in locally produced raspberries for their use in fruit wines, which can be an outlet for excess fruit.\nFruit can also be frozen for later use in locally produced value-added processed products.\nFor more information on marketing, consult Fruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Part-time Growers and Developing a Roadside Market.\nPrices growers have reported obtaining for fresh-market red raspberries vary tremendously depending on location--from as little as $1.50 per pound pick-your-own in rural locations, to as high as $5.00 per ready-picked half-pint clamshell in locations near population centers.\nProcessed raspberry prices in traditional outlets typically have been only one-third to one-half that obtained for fresh-market berries.\nPotential growers should conduct a quick survey of local prices for red raspberries before establishing their plantings.\nWhile high prices can be obtained for red raspberries, these delicate fruits are susceptible to numerous diseases and insects (including spotted wing drosophila, a new invasive fruit fly that infests the fruit), require a great deal of labor for hand-harvesting fresh-market fruit (machine harvest is an option only for berries that will be processed), and have a very short shelf life.\nTherefore, the production of a good crop from year to year requires careful management.\nRed raspberries grow best on sunny sites with well-drained soil.\nAlso, red raspberry plantings should not follow Verticillium-susceptible crops, such as peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, or strawberries.\nCover cropping for at least a year with rye or sudangrass is a highly recommended practice that will help control weeds prior to planting the raspberries.\nThe red raspberry plant has one of two growth habits: summer bearing or everbearing.\nSummer-bearing (also referred to as floricane-fruiting) are the most common type of raspberry in the bramble family.\nIn the first year of planting, vegetative canes are produced.\nThe following year, these same canes flower and produce fruit.\nWhile they are flowering and fruiting, new vegetative canes (\"suckers\") are produced from buds on the roots and grow throughout the summer.\nFruiting canes die shortly after producing that year's crop.\nTherefore, a mature raspberry planting has two types of canes: vegetative canes that originated during the current year (primocanes), and fruiting canes that originated during the previous year (floricanes).\nEverbearing (also referred to as primocane-fruiting or fall-bearing) raspberries produce primocanes that are capable of flowering and fruiting in the same year that they are produced.\nBecause the canes don't reach their mature length until mid-summer, fruiting is later than for summer-bearing raspberries.\nThe canes of primocane-bearing raspberry plants are usually mowed to the ground every winter because the next year's crop does not require the previous season's canes.\nHowever, if the canes are not removed, they will produce a small summer crop from previously unbroken fruit buds low on the cane and, hence, are sometimes referred to as \"everbearers.\" Some commonly grown cultivars of summer-bearing red raspberries are Boyne (early season), Nova (mid-season), and Taylor (late season).\nThe presence of spotted wing drosophila is making production of fall fruit on everbearers exceedingly difficult, so growers are encouraged to choose summer-bearing varieties, which are largely finished fruiting by the time this pest is present.\nBoth summer-bearing and everbearing cultivars readily produce new shoots from the roots (called \"suckering\").\nRed raspberries usually are planted 24 inches apart in rows that are 8 to 12 feet apart.\nPlants will produce many suckers in the first year.\nSome pests, such as spotted wing drosophila, affect the fruit, while others, such as cane borers, attack the plant.\nMany pest problems can be avoided through proper site selection, crop rotation, variety selection, soil treatment, and by planting disease-free plants.\nWeeds must be controlled in a raspberry planting.\nWith summer-bearing red raspberries, the first significant crop is usually obtained during the third year after planting.\nPrimocane-bearing plants usually yield a significant crop in the second year.\nAt maturity (about four years old), plants should produce about 5,000 pounds of fruit per acre, though not all will be harvested in pick-your-own fields.\nBecause of the extremely short shelf life of red raspberries, good postharvest practices are essential.\nRed raspberries must be picked and handled very carefully.\nIf harvested at the proper time and handled carefully, raspberries will remain in good condition for several days.\nIn the normal course of operations, farmers handle pesticides and other chemicals, may have manure to collect and spread, and use equipment to prepare fields and harvest crops.\nContact your soil and water conservation district, extension office, zoning board, state departments of agriculture and environmental protection, and your local governing authorities to determine what regulations may pertain to your operation.\nAlso, several major food distribution chains are beginning to require GAP- and GHP-certified products from their producers.\nYou will need to have any water supply used by your workers or for crop irrigation and pesticide application checked at least twice each year.\nFor more information about GAPs and GHPs, contact your local extension office or your state's Department of Agriculture.\nThere are crop insurance programs designed to help farmers manage both yield risk and revenue shortfalls.\nIf individual coverage is not available for what you grow, you may be able to use the AGR/AGR-Lite program to insure the revenue of your entire farm operation.\nFor more information concerning crop insurance, contact a crop insurance agent or check the Penn State Extension website.\nFinally, the USDA Farm Service Agency has a program called the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP) that is designed to provide a minimal level of yield risk protection for producers of commercial agricultural products that don't have multi-peril crop insurance coverage.\nIncluded in this publication are five annual budgets for red raspberry production.\nThe first summarizes the costs of land preparation, the second covers establishment of the red raspberry planting, and the third summarizes costs and returns for the year after planting.\nThe fourth summarizes the costs and returns for a mature (four-year-old) red raspberry planting for retail marketing.\nThese years would have fewer receipts and lower harvest costs than a mature planting.\nWhile the budgets are calculated for one acre of production, a beginning grower should start much smaller.\nMore information on the use of crop budgets can be found in Budgeting for Agricultural Decision Making.\nYou can use the red Clear Form button to clear all the information from your budget when you are finished.\nFruit and Vegetable Marketing for Small-scale and Parttime Growers.\nIrrigation for Fruit and Vegetable Production.\nThis publication was developed by the Small-scale and Part-time Farming Project at Penn State with support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Extension Service."

        "2": "And, each delicate raspberry is packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.\nRaspberries can be found in four different colors: red, black, purple, and gold.\nOne cup of raspberries provides 8 grams of fiber, far more than most fruits in the produce aisle.\nRaspberries contain much less sugar than most fruits — just 5 grams in an entire cup, making them less likely to raise your blood sugar levels.\nRaspberries add a sweet taste to dishes, which can reduce your desire to sweeten food with artificial preservatives helping you lose weight and control your blood sugar levels.\nRaspberries are high in antioxidants that can protect cells from damage by free radicals.\nBlack raspberries offer the most antioxidants, followed by red and then golden raspberries.\nRaspberries also contain Vitamin C, which is vital to collagen production, a protein that makes up 75% of your skin.\nRaspberries are loaded with Vitamin C, which may also help prevent and repair skin damage from the sun.\nThe same amount of plain Greek yogurt and ½ cup of raspberries provides almost double the amount of food with only 14 grams of carbs and less than 10 grams of sugar.\nEach of the four types of raspberries — red, black, purple, and gold — are distinct in taste.\nPurple raspberries are a cross between the red and black."

        "1": "White rice has had the fibre-rich outer bran of the grain removed along-with the nutrient-rich germ.\nBrown rice, on the other hand, contains both the bran and germ, making it nutrient- and fibre-rich and retains a nutty flavour.\nBrown rice contains fibre and protein, both known to have a satiating effect and contributing to a lower glycaemic index (GI) than that of white rice.\nFor this reason, opting for brown rice over white helps reduce blood glucose and fasting insulin levels.\nHowever, it is thought that a substantial serving of white rice, eaten on a regular basis, may lead to elevations in blood sugar levels, which over time may increase your risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain.\nBrown rice retains the bran layer and as such contains protective compounds called flavonoids, examples of these include apigenin and quercetin.\nNumerous studies suggest including wholegrains, like brown rice, in the diet is linked to a reduced risk of conditions like heart disease, some cancers including pancreatic and gastric cancers as well as type 2 diabetes.\nWhite rice is easily digested, low in fibre and when cooked and served correctly is unlikely to cause gastric upset.\nThe brown, wholegrain variety is especially useful because it supplies insoluble fibre, which promotes digestive function and ‘fuels’ the beneficial gut bacteria which are so important for health.\nRice is an important dietary staple however, reports have linked it with arsenic contamination, high levels of which, over a consistent period, have been linked with an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.\nThe accumulation of arsenic tends to be greatest in the bran part of the grain, which means wholegrain rice may potentially have higher amounts of this heavy metal contaminant than white rice.\nThis risk is increased by their limited dietary choices and the fact that many first foods are rice-based.",

        "0": "The population of wild salmon declined markedly in recent decades, especially North Atlantic populations which spawn in the waters of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild salmon in the Snake and Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe decline is attributed to the following factors: The transfer of parasites from open-net cage salmon farming, especially sea lice, has reduced numbers of wild salmon.\nIt is reported that wild salmon on the west coast of Canada are being driven to extinction by sea lice from nearby salmon farms.[2] Dr Krkosek and his research group found, with their electronic modeling predictions, two of the best runs ever recorded for wild salmon instead of the expected collapsed salmon fishery.\nSeveral seafood sustainability guides have recommendations on which salmon fisheries are sustainable and which have negative impacts on salmon populations There are many methods of harvest for the commercial salmon fishing industry, such as trolling, seining, and gillnetting.\nGillnets are an extremely size-selective method of harvest, where a long net is placed in the path of the salmon's migration to their natal stream in hopes of entangling the salmon for commercial harvest.\nFor example, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 2010 Commercial Regulations had a 7-inch (180 mm) minimum mesh size restriction for Chinook, and a 5-inch (130 mm) minimum – 5.5-inch (140 mm) maximum for sockeye.[4] Possible problems arising from this selective harvest are smaller reproducing adult fish, as well as the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery.\nA recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests.\nThe study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946 to 2005 was 8 mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.[3] If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it often sustains injuries.\nA study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11 – 29% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.[5] Competition between juvenile salmon entering the ocean, other wild salmon, and hatchery-released salmon in the ocean is a major factor that determines survival rates.[6] Hatchery production has increased since 1970, and there is high spatial and trophic, dietary overlap between wild and hatchery sockeye, pink and chum salmon in the North Pacific.[7] With more competition for prey and space in the ocean, the period of maturation in saltwater before salmon reach sexual spawning age grows.\nWarmer temperatures of streams during spawning and incubation have negative effects on salmon productivity due to pre-spawn mortality, reduced egg survival, and temporal changes during salmon embryo development.[8] However, the effects of higher stream temperatures during juvenile rearing vary across populations and habitats.\nFor some watersheds as temperatures increase, an increase in turbidity and reduction in invertebrate food availability is found to cause a reduction in growth rates of juvenile salmon.\nReduced retention of the nutrients brought by the returning adult salmon in stream pools has lowered population numbers.\nThe construction of dams, weirs, barriers and other \"food prevention\" measures bring severe adverse impacts to river habitat and on the accessibility of those habitats to salmon, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where large numbers of dams have been built in many river systems, including over 400 in the Columbia River Basin.[9] Other environmental factors, such as light intensity, water flow, or change in temperature, dramatically affects salmon during their migration season.[10] Modern farming methods and various sources of pollution have resulted in loss of invertebrate diversity and population density in rivers, thus reducing food availability.\nReduction in freshwater base flow in rivers and disruption of seasonal flows, because of diversions and extractions, hydroelectric power generation, irrigation schemes, barge transportation, and slackwater reservoirs, inhibit normal migratory processes and increase predation for salmon.[11] Agricultural practices, such as the removal of riparian plants, destabilization of stream banks by livestock and irrigation processes, result in a loss of suitable low-gradient stream habitats.[12][13] Climate change is affecting different types of salmon in ways from short term affects such as a decrease in population to long term affects such as evolution change.\nThe change in temperature has left salmon most vulnerable during their egg stage, and the becoming adult stage of its life cycle (9) Climate change has caused salmon to spend less time in their natural freshwater habitat (10) (1).\nThis type of stressor can affect the age class of salmon because it causes them to migrate at an early stage, which would cause them to delay maturation making them spend an additional year feeding in the ocean.\nWhen the water temperature increases the thermal requirements for the three species (Atlantic Salmon, Brown Trout, and Arctic Charr) are a necessity because if any other problems occur it can be predicted/anticipated by those of the biodiversity in the freshwater ecosystems (2).\nThis can cause a population crash since the increased temperature will affect the eggs and may also bring in more diseases and illnesses towards the species (6).\nThese species of fish help support and provide for important fisheries in Western Europe, so, according to a scholarly journal their research finding say that salmon populations changes from environmental issues has a massive affect many other populations in distant habitats (2)(3).\nThe long term affects from climate change produce more selection pressures in different parts of salmon's life such as Juvenile growth, development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance.\nIn Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed.\nMeanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill—net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.\nThe commercial salmon fisheries in California have been either severely curtailed or closed completely in recent years, due to critically low returns on the Klamath and or Sacramento Rivers, causing millions of dollars in losses to commercial fishermen.[22] Both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are popular sportfish.\nResults overall show estuary problems exist for some rivers, but issues involving feeding grounds at sea are impacting populations as well.\nThe Puget Sound Partnership has now rehabilitated over 800 acres of salmon habitat and it plans to continue to fight nearshore development and human impact affecting important salmon ecosystems.",
        "1": "Historically, adult salmon returns to the Columbia Basin were at least 10 to 16 million fish annually — today, across the Northwest, less than 5 percent of historic populations of wild salmon and steelhead return to our rivers and streams.\nMore than 135 other fish and wildlife populations benefit from the presence of wild salmon and steelhead, from southern resident orca whales, which are at a 30-year population low, to eagles, wolves, bear, otter, coyote, seals and sea lions.\nJoseph Bogaard, executive director of the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, says the impact on orcas is immense.\nLack of chinook salmon has been strongly implicated as the main cause of decline.” Other animals and plant life aren’t the only ones that lose out when salmon are lost, our very landscape and culture are at stake as well, argues Langdon Cook, author of “Upstream: Searching for Wild Salmon, from River to Table.” “Salmon are a keystone species in the Pacific Northwest… they have shaped our landscape as much as the glaciers and volcanoes.\n“The most important action we can take to help salmon and steelhead survive and thrive is to restore healthy habitat and access to healthy habitat.” Montgomery, studied three different salmon habitats in his book “King of Fish”: the United Kingdom, New England and the Pacific Northwest.\n“I researched those various factors and how they’ve affected salmon throughout history and found commonalities that were repeating in the Northwest that have already played out in Europe and New England, where their salmon decline was not only dramatic, it became permanent.” Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition of more than 40 organizations including conservation organizations, recreational and commercial fishing associations and clean energy and orca advocates, is working to secure removal of the four lower Snake River dams in southeastern Washington state and to include “ecosystem function” in the upcoming U.S.-Canada Columbia River Treaty negotiations.\n“The Snake River Basin, in central Idaho, Northeast Oregon and Southeast Washington, has more than 5,500 miles of healthy, pristine, often high and cold, protected salmon habitat,” says Bogaard.\nFour costly, outdated dams on the lower Snake River.” Bogaard believes dam removal is one of the most important opportunities to restore salmon habitats and access to those habitats.\n“Since then, salmon and steelhead populations have begun to reinhabit stretches of river that have not seen salmon in 100 years,” he says.\nWhen rivers are restored and fish allowed to return, whole ecosystems can be restored.” In addition to dam removal, there are other environmental changes impacting salmon that we can reverse if we act soon, says Jacques White, executive director of Long Live the Kings, a 31-year-old conservation organization dedicated to protecting and restoring the wild salmon and steelhead populations.\n“You can help restore salmon habitat in your community by practicing low-impact landscaping and gardening,” says White.\nThis label recognizes farmers who adopt conservations practices that help promote healthy watersheds and protect native salmon habitat, says David J.\n“The Salmon-Safe label is a great addition to organic certification because it shows a commitment to restoring local salmon streams, an important issue to farm customers and community,” Burger says.\n“Farms that go through the assessment sometimes have conditions that identify areas for improvement that include; manure management, fish passage, habitat restoration (planting trees and shrubs) and improving irrigation practices.” To get involved and stay up-to-date on salmon conservation legislation and news, visit Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition of conservationists, fishermen and clean-energy and orca advocates pressing elected officials to restore the health of the Columbia-Snake River Basin.",

        "1": "Although there is no recommended daily intake (RDI) of omega-3 fatty acids, many health organizations recommend that healthy adults get a minimum of 250–500 mg of combined EPA and DHA per day (3Trusted Source).\nEPA and DHA have been credited with several health benefits, such as decreasing inflammation, lowering blood pressure, reducing the risk of cancer and improving the function of the cells that line your arteries (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nA 2012 analysis of 16 controlled studies found that taking 0.45–4.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day led to significant improvements in arterial function (8Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, studies have shown that getting these omega-3 fats from fish increases levels in your body just as effectively as supplementing with fish oil capsules (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nAs for how much fish to eat, consuming at least two servings of salmon per week can help meet your omega-3 fatty acid needs.\nSalmon is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure and decrease risk factors for disease.\nRecent research has found that for optimal health, each meal should provide at least 20–30 grams of high-quality protein (16Trusted Source).\nBelow is the B vitamin content in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of wild salmon (2): These vitamins are involved in several important processes in your body, including turning the food you eat into energy, creating and repairing DNA and reducing the inflammation that can lead to heart disease (17Trusted Source).\nSalmon is an excellent source of several B vitamins, which are needed for energy production, controlling inflammation and protecting heart and brain health.\nA large analysis of 31 studies found that supplementing with potassium significantly reduced blood pressure, especially when added to a high-sodium diet (22Trusted Source).\n100 grams of salmon provide 11–18% of the RDI of potassium, which helps control blood pressure and prevent excess fluid retention.\nStudies have shown that selenium helps protect bone health, decreases thyroid antibodies in people with autoimmune thyroid disease and may reduce the risk of cancer (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).\nConsuming salmon and other high-selenium seafood has been shown to improve blood levels of selenium in people whose diets are low in this mineral (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nOne study found that blood levels of selenium increased significantly more in people who consumed two servings of salmon per week than those who consumed fish oil capsules containing less selenium (29Trusted Source).\nA 100-gram serving of salmon provides 59–67% of the RDI of selenium, a mineral involved in protecting bone health, improving thyroid function and reducing the risk of cancer.\nAstaxanthin appears to lower the risk of heart disease by reducing oxidation of LDL (the “bad”) cholesterol and increasing HDL (the “good”) cholesterol (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nOne study found that 3.6 mg of astaxanthin daily was enough to reduce oxidation of LDL cholesterol, which could potentially reduce the risk of heart disease (30Trusted Source).\nIn addition, astaxanthin is believed to work with salmon’s omega-3 fatty acids to protect the brain and nervous system from inflammation (32Trusted Source).\nResearch suggests that when the balance of these two fatty acids is off, the risk of heart disease increases (37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).\nIn a four-week study of healthy men and women, consuming two servings of farmed salmon per week increased omega-3 blood levels by 8–9% and decreased omega-6 levels (39Trusted Source).\nAlso, consuming salmon and other fatty fish has been found to lower triglycerides and raise levels of omega-3 fats more than fish oil supplements do (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source).\nConsuming salmon can help protect against heart disease by increasing levels of omega-3 fats, decreasing levels of omega-6 fats and lowering triglycerides.\nIn addition, your metabolic rate increases more after eating protein-rich foods like salmon, compared to other foods (43Trusted Source).\nOne study in children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease found that supplementing with DHA, the main omega-3 found in salmon, led to significantly greater reductions in liver fat and belly fat, compared to a placebo (46Trusted Source).\nSeveral studies have found that eating more salmon helps reduce markers of inflammation in people at risk for these and other diseases (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source).\nIn an eight-week study of middle-aged and elderly Chinese women, consuming 3 ounces (80 grams) of salmon and other fatty fish daily led to reductions in the inflammatory markers TNF-a and IL-6 (35Trusted Source).\nIn another eight-week study, 12 men with ulcerative colitis who consumed 21 ounces (600 grams) of salmon per week experienced a decrease in inflammatory markers in their blood and colon, along with self-reported improvements in symptoms (51Trusted Source).\nSalmon and other fatty fish can help lower inflammation, which may reduce risk factors for several diseases and improve symptoms in people with inflammatory conditions.\nBoth fatty fish and fish oil have been found to reduce depressive symptoms, protect fetal brain health during pregnancy, decrease anxiety, slow age-related memory loss and lower the risk of dementia (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).\nFrequent salmon consumption may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, protect fetal brain health in pregnancy and decrease the risk of age-related memory problems.\nAdditionally, canned salmon is a quick and inexpensive option that provides the same impressive health benefits as fresh fish.\nConsuming at least two servings per week can help you meet your nutrient needs and reduce the risk of several diseases.",
        "2": "However, salmon is a nutrient-dense fish that can be found with minimal toxins, especially if you buy it wild.\nWith salmon's heart-healthy omega-3s, high-quality protein, and rich micronutrient content, it's worth adding to your meal plan.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 3 ounces (85g) of raw, wild Atlantic salmon.1﻿ Salmon is naturally free of carbohydrates, including fiber and sugar.\nA 3-ounce serving of raw salmon has 5.4 grams of fat.\nThe fatty acid profile of salmon varies depending on whether it is farm-raised or wild-caught.\nFarmed salmon is higher in fat content overall, including saturated fat.\nWild salmon is leaner.2﻿ There are 17 grams of protein in a 3-ounce fillet of raw, wild-caught salmon.\nBecause farm-raised salmon has more fat, it contains slightly less protein by weight.\nRegardless, salmon is an excellent source of high-quality complete protein that provides all of the essential amino acids our bodies require.\nIt is one of the few natural food sources of vitamin D (wild salmon is a particularly good source).3﻿ Salmon is also rich in several minerals including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium.\nFish has been long considered a health-promoting food.\nCanned wild salmon is an excellent source of both vitamin D and calcium—two essential bone-building nutrients.\nWhile farmed salmon also provides some vitamin D, the amount varies based on the type of feed used.\nStudies predict that increasing the vitamin D content of farm-raised salmon would have positive effects on human bone health.3﻿ Salmon's high protein content also contributes to bone health by supporting muscle strength.\nInsufficient omega-3 intake during pregnancy and breastfeeding has been found to hinder infant brain growth.6﻿ Salmon is lower in mercury than larger fish, like tuna or swordfish, making it a good choice for pregnant women to regularly consume in moderation.\nAstaxanthin is a carotenoid with neuroprotective properties that appear to work in conjunction with omega-3s to slow the aging of the brain.8﻿ Allergy to fish, including salmon, is potentially life-threatening with anaphylaxis as a common symptom.9﻿ Fish allergies are different than allergies to other types of seafood, like shellfish.\nIf you suspect an allergy to salmon or other finned fish, see an allergist for a full evaluation and treatment plan.\nThere is some controversy about eating wild versus farmed salmon.\nBut researchers also acknowledge that the benefits of salmon consumption may outweigh potential risks.12﻿ To reduce your risk and gain the benefits of eating salmon, look for wild-caught salmon, if possible.\nSalmon can be purchased fresh, frozen, smoked, or canned (which is typically wild-caught).\nThere are several varieties of salmon, including Atlantic, Chinook, coho, and sockeye salmon which are farmed or fished all over the world.13﻿ Salmon can be found at any time of the year in the grocery store or seafood markets.\nWhole fish should have clear, shiny eyes, firm flesh that springs back when pressed, and should smell fresh and mild (never overly fishy or like ammonia).14﻿ When buying frozen seafood, watch out for broken packaging or packaging with frozen ice crystals that may indicate that the package was allowed to thawed and refreeze.\nEating undercooked or raw seafood is dangerous, especially for pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.\nIf you choose to eat raw salmon in sushi or sashimi, be sure to go to a reputable restaurant and understand that there are risks of foodborne illness.\nFish, salmon, Atlantic, wild, raw.\nFish faceoff: Wild salmon vs.\nfarmed salmon.\ndoi:10.18632/oncotarget.10171 American Heart Association.\nEating Fish for Heart Health.\ndoi:10.3390/md16080247 Fish allergy.\nThe role of persistent organic pollutants in the worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the possible connection to Farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).\nSchwager, Quantitative analysis of the benefits and risks of consuming farmed and wild Salmon, The Journal of Nutrition, Volume 135, Issue 11, November 2005, Pages 2639–2643, doi: 10.1093/jn/135.11.2639 Salmon recommendations."

        "1": "Additionally, it is commonly believed that farm-raised shrimp may have some negative health effects compared to wild-caught shrimp.\nAdditionally, the same serving size provides more than 20 different vitamins and minerals, including 50% of your daily needs for selenium, a mineral that may help reduce inflammation and promote heart health (1, 2Trusted Source).\nShrimp is also one of the best food sources of iodine, an important mineral that many people are deficient in.\nShrimp is also a good source of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to astaxanthin antioxidants, which may have a variety of health benefits (1, 6Trusted Source).\nMany people fear foods that are high in cholesterol due to the belief that they increase the cholesterol in your blood, and thus promote heart disease.\nThis is because most of the cholesterol in your blood is produced by your liver, and when you eat foods high in cholesterol, your liver produces less (8Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\nWhat’s more, shrimp contains several nutrients that may actually boost health, such as omega-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin antioxidants (6Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nBoth of these are important factors in reducing the risk of heart disease (14Trusted Source).\nAnother study found that 356 women who consumed shellfish, including shrimp, on a regular basis had significantly lower triglycerides and blood pressure levels compared to those who did not include shellfish in their diets (15Trusted Source).\nResearch has also shown that people who consume shrimp regularly do not have a higher risk of heart disease compared to those who do not eat it (16Trusted Source).\nAlthough more research is needed to explore shrimp’s role in heart health, it has a variety of beneficial properties that may outweigh its cholesterol content.\nFirst, many studies have found astaxanthin may help strengthen arteries, which may reduce the risk of heart attacks.\nIt may also help increase levels of “good” HDL cholesterol, an important factor in heart health (6Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\nDespite these findings, more human research is needed to determine the overall role that the astaxanthin in shrimp may have on overall health.\nFarm-raised seafood from other countries is frequently treated with antibiotics due to its high susceptibility to disease.\nBecause of this, farm-raised shrimp contaminated with antibiotics has the potential to enter the US food supply (25Trusted Source).\nOne study that investigated the antibiotic content of US-purchased seafood found that a sample of farm-raised shrimp contained a detectable amount of sulfadimethoxine, an antibiotic not permitted for use in shrimp in the US (25Trusted Source).\nShellfish, including shrimp, are classified as one of the top eight food allergies in the US, along with fish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, milk and soy (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nOther proteins in shrimp that may trigger an allergic reaction include arginine kinase and hemocyanin (32Trusted Source).\nSymptoms of shrimp allergies vary, and may include tingling in the mouth, digestive issues, nasal congestion or skin reactions after eating it (33Trusted Source).\nIt is high in several vitamins and minerals, and is a rich source of protein.\nEating shrimp may also promote heart and brain health due to its content of omega-3 fatty acids and the antioxidant astaxanthin (6Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nAlthough shrimp is high in cholesterol, it has not been found to have a negative impact on heart health.\nEating shrimp may actually help lower your levels of triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\nDespite the health benefits of shrimp, there are some concerns about the quality of farm-raised shrimp, such as potential contamination with antibiotics.\nHere are 7 high-cholesterol foods that are very healthy.\nShrimp was once considered bad for heart health and cholesterol numbers.\nBut high LDL cholesterol levels in… The role of dietary cholesterol in human health has been a controversial topic.",

        "1": "Sour cream is a traditional, fermented dairy food and it has been part of the human diet for centuries.\nThis misguided demonization of dietary fats is now inexcusable, and sour cream is enjoying a resurgence as a health food.\nThis article will take a look at the nutritional value of sour cream and eight significant health benefits.\nKey Point: As shown above, sour cream has a healthy nutritional profile and contains a range of beneficial nutrients.\nOne of the biggest benefits of sour cream is that it is high in dairy fat.\nKey Point: The vast majority of studies over the last decade suggest that dairy fats are healthy and protective against disease.\nThe dairy fat content is one of the best health benefits of sour cream.\nAs we saw from the nutrition tables, sour cream contains a broad range of nutrients.\nOne serving of sour cream contains approximately 13% of the RDA for phosphorus.\nHowever, animal foods such as sour cream supply vitamin A in its pre-formed state.\nA half cup of sour cream contains around 13% of the RDA for vitamin A.\nKey Point: One of the advantages of sour cream is that it supplies a decent amount of riboflavin, vitamin A and phosphorus.\nNot only do you need fat to absorb the nutrients in your food, but there is also the taste factor.\nTherefore, ditch the fat-free salad dressing and try making your own at home.\nKey Point: Ignore conventional (and illogical) advice to use low-fat dressings on salad.\nOn a similar theme, if you want to make a dipping sauce then sour cream provides a great base.\nKey Point: Sour cream is versatile and works well in a range of recipes.\nWith 22.5g fat and only 5.3g carbohydrate per half-cup serving, sour cream is a healthy and perfectly viable food for low carb and ketogenic diets.\nSour cream also makes a great combination with many different low carb foods.\nKey Point: Sour cream is extremely low in dietary carbohydrate and is very high in fat.\nA keto and low carb recipe that combines twice-cooked cabbage, bacon, sour cream and cheese.\nA keto blue-cheese dressing that is ideal for a salad and also works as a dipping sauce.\nIt is a low-carb version of Mexican food and combines beef, oil, seasonings, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, avocado, salt and sour cream.\nOver recent years, more and more studies appear to support dairy fat as heart-protective.\nDespite this, it seems that fermented dairy such as cheese and sour cream takes it one step further regarding benefits.\nKey Point: Fermented dairy foods such as sour cream appear to have even better benefits than non-fermented dairy products.\nSimilar to all dairy products, sour cream provides a significant amount of calcium.\nIn combination with vital co-factors such as magnesium, vitamin D and vitamin K, calcium plays a major role in bone density and protecting against tooth decay (17, 18).\nKey Point: Sour cream provides a large amount of dietary calcium.\nAs calcium deficiency is quite common, dairy foods are an important source of the mineral.\nSour cream is a delicious high-fat dairy food that is full of beneficial nutrients.",

One of the antioxidants in spinach, called lutein, has been shown to reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur the sharp, central vision required for activities like reading and driving.\nIn one Japanese study, researchers examined the eyes of 11 healthy nonsmokers who consumed 75 grams of frozen spinach containing 10 mg of lutein daily for two months.\nThis research indicates that spinach may help curb AMD risk.\nWhile I recommend incorporating spinach into both raw and cooked dishes, some research shows that not cooking the greens is the best way to preserve its lutein content.\nThe longer the spinach was boiled, the lower the remaining lutein level.\nScientists say the best way to consume spinach for maximum lutein intake may be in a smoothie combined with a healthful fat, such as avocado or almond butter.\nThat’s because when spinach is chopped into small pieces, more lutein is released from the leaves, and fat increases the ability to absorb the antioxidant.\nOlder research found that cooking also impacts the folate content of spinach; boiling slashed this B vitamin level by nearly half.\nA recent study looked at the effect of different cooking methods on the vitamin content in selected vegetables, included spinach.\nCooking also diminished the vitamin E levels in spinach, but increased the vitamin A content.",
        "1": "Eating spinach may benefit eye health, reduce oxidative stress, help prevent cancer, and reduce blood pressure levels.\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw spinach are (1Trusted Source): Most of the carbs in spinach consist of fiber, which is incredibly healthy.\nSpinach is high in insoluble fiber, which may boost your health in several ways (2Trusted Source).\nSpinach is extremely healthy and linked to numerous health benefits.\nIt has been shown to improve oxidative stress, eye health, and blood pressure.\nThey can cause oxidative stress, which triggers accelerated aging and increases your risk of cancer and diabetes (11Trusted Source).\nHowever, spinach contains antioxidants, which fight oxidative stress and help reduce the damage it causes.\nOne study in eight healthy people found that spinach helped prevent oxidative damage.\nHuman eyes also contain high quantities of these pigments, which protect your eyes from the damage caused by sunlight (15Trusted Source).\nEating this leafy green may also help prevent breast cancer (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\nLikewise, one animal study notes that spinach might suppress cancer formation (26Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, spinach packs high amounts of antioxidants, which may also fight cancer (27Trusted Source).\nSpinach contains high amounts of nitrates, which have been shown to help moderate blood pressure levels and decrease your risk of heart disease (28, 29).\nOne study in 27 people found that eating spinach effectively lowered blood pressure levels.\nSeveral other studies observed similar effects, indicating that spinach boosts heart health (7Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).\nIt may reduce oxidative stress, promote eye health, fight cancer, and regulate blood pressure.\nPeople who are taking blood thinners, such as warfarin, should consult with their healthcare practitioner before eating large amounts of spinach (34Trusted Source).\nThis leafy green is also very high in vitamin K1, which can be a problem for people on blood thinners.\nThis vegetable has been shown to benefit health in several ways.\nSpinach may decrease oxidative stress, improve eye health, and help prevent heart disease and cancer.\nThis article compares spinach and kale to… Packed with nutrients but low in calories, leafy greens are crucial to a wholesome diet.\nSome studies show that it can help you lose… Spinach is packed with nutrients and antioxidants.",
        "2": "This article will provide a science-backed guide to spinach and its health benefits.\nAs shown in the table, spinach is a very low-energy food and contains a minimal amount of calories.\nSpinach is a rich source of minerals, and it is particularly high in vitamin K1 and carotenoid vitamin A precursors.\nSpinach is a rich source of manganese and magnesium, and it contains a range of other minerals in small to moderate amounts.\nMost of the health benefits that spinach can confer relate to the nutrients it provides.\nAdditionally, spinach contains some interesting compounds such as kaempferol and nitrate, and these compounds may have a beneficial impact on our body.\nSpinach is one of the biggest food sources of provitamin A carotenoids.\nIn contrast to bio-available vitamin A (retinol) found in oily fish, eggs, and organ meats, carotenoids are not in a form the body can readily use (4).\nTo use carotenoids, our body must first convert these compounds into retinol.\nHowever, because spinach still contains such a large amount of carotenoids, this would still provide benefit.\nAdditionally, some carotenoid compounds have further interesting effects rather than just vitamin A activity.\nResearchers suggest that the efficiency at which humans absorb the vitamin K in spinach could be as low as 10% (7).\nWe can also increase the absorption rate of all fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) by consuming them alongside a source of fat.\nAmong vegetable sources of vitamin C, spinach is one of the best, and it provides almost 50% of the RDA per 100 grams.\nSpinach is rich in dietary folate, and it contains 49% of the RDA per 100 grams.\nHowever, since these foods are often a rich source of nutrients and phytonutrients, it is likely that they can help to boost various measures of our health.\nThis natural compound can accumulate in plants growing in nitrate-rich soil, and it can have some beneficial effects when we consume it.\nKaempferol is a flavonoid polyphenol which we can find in certain plant foods, and spinach is a particularly high source (23).\nAs mentioned earlier, spinach is a significant source of carotenoid compounds.\nSpinach is one of the most concentrated sources of oxalate out of all food (28).\nHowever, realistic servings of spinach are not a problem for the majority of people, and many different foods also contain oxalic acid.\nOverall, spinach is a very healthy food that has a range of health benefits.\nIt is rich in vitamins and minerals, and it contains some other bioactive compounds that may further benefit our health.\nFor more on leafy greens, see this guide to the potential benefits of kale."

        "1": "These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nHere’s everything you need to know about sunflower seeds, including their nutrition, benefits and how to eat them.\nSunflower seeds are technically the fruits of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus) (1Trusted Source).\nA single sunflower head may contain up to 2,000 seeds (2Trusted Source).\nOne type is grown for the seeds you eat, while the other — which is the majority farmed — is grown for the oil (1Trusted Source).\nAdditionally, sunflower seeds are a good source of beneficial plant compounds, including phenolic acids and flavonoids — which also function as antioxidants (6Trusted Source).\nWhen sunflower seeds are sprouted, their plant compounds increase.\nYou can buy sprouted, dried sunflower seeds online or in some stores (6Trusted Source).\nSunflower seeds are excellent sources of several nutrients — including vitamin E and selenium — and beneficial plant compounds that can help prevent chronic diseases.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds (1Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\nFor example, increased blood levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (11Trusted Source).\nIn a study in more than 6,000 adults, those who reported eating sunflower seeds and other seeds at least five times a week had 32% lower levels of C-reactive protein compared to people who ate no seeds (11Trusted Source).\nThough this type of study cannot prove cause and effect, it is known that vitamin E — which is abundant in sunflower seeds — helps lower C-reactive protein levels (12Trusted Source).\nFlavonoids and other plant compounds in sunflower seeds also help reduce inflammation (6Trusted Source).\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease, which can lead to heart attack or stroke (13Trusted Source).\nThe magnesium in sunflower seeds helps reduce blood pressure levels as well (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\nThis fatty acid also helps lower cholesterol (14, 15Trusted Source).\nIn a 3-week study, women with type 2 diabetes who ate 1 ounce (30 grams) of sunflower seeds daily as part of a balanced diet experienced a 5% drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of a reading) (7Trusted Source).\nThe effects of sunflower seeds on blood sugar and type 2 diabetes have been tested in a few studies and seem promising, but more research is needed (7Trusted Source, 17).\nStudies suggest that people who eat 1 ounce (30 grams) of sunflower seeds daily as part of a healthy diet may reduce fasting blood sugar by about 10% within six months, compared to a healthy diet alone (7Trusted Source, 18).\nThe blood-sugar-lowering effect of sunflower seeds may partially be due to the plant compound chlorogenic acid (19Trusted Source, 20).\nStudies also suggest that adding sunflower seeds to foods like bread may help decrease carbs’ effect on your blood sugar.\nSunflower seeds contain nutrients and plant compounds that help reduce your risk of inflammation, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nEating the seeds in the shell is a simple way to slow your eating pace and calorie intake while snacking, as it takes time to crack open and spit out each shell.\nHowever, if you’re watching your salt intake, keep in mind that the shells — which people commonly suck on before cracking them open — are often coated with more than 2,500 mg of sodium — 108% of the RDI — per 1/4 cup (30 grams) (23Trusted Source).\nSunflowers tend to take up cadmium from the soil and deposit it in their seeds, so they contain somewhat higher amounts than most other foods (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).\nOccasionally, seeds are contaminated with harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella, which can thrive in the warm, moist conditions of sprouting (27Trusted Source).\nOne study found that drying partially sprouted sunflower seeds at temperatures of 122℉ (50℃) and above significantly reduced Salmonella presence (27Trusted Source).\nEating a large number of sunflower seeds at once has occasionally resulted in fecal impaction — or stool blockages — in both children and adults (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).\nEating sunflower seeds in the shell may increase your odds of fecal impaction, as you may unintentionally eat shell fragments, which your body cannot digest (28Trusted Source).\nUnshelled sunflower seeds are a popular snack, while shelled varieties can be eaten by the handful or added to any number of foods, such as trail mix, salads and baked goods.\nThey pack various nutrients and plant compounds that may help fight inflammation, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nIf you like to snack on sunflower seeds, you might wonder how healthy they are for you.\nHere’s more information about the number of calories in each… Along with a healthy diet, seeds can help reduce blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure.",
        "2": "Sunflower seeds are a nutrient-dense source of essential vitamins and minerals vital to maintaining good health, including selenium and vitamin E, which may have anti-cancer properties both in the formation of tumors and possibly in slowing down the progression of the disease.\nLet’s get started… Sunflower seeds are loaded with nutrition, including a number of minerals and vitamins and lots of phytosterols, protein, fat, and fiber.\nFrom a mineral perspective, sunflower seeds also contain high amounts of selenium, manganese, copper, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as some calcium, iron, potassium, and zinc.\nTwo nutrients that improve cardiovascular health are vitamin E and folate, both of which are found in sunflower seeds.\nAlso, anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants in sunflower seeds help reduce oxidative stress and damaging free radicals in the body.\nSunflower seeds contain phytosterols that have been linked to healthy cholesterol levels.\nThe phytosterols in sunflower seeds help balance high cholesterol levels, and this can help prevent cardiovascular disease overall.\nThe magnesium content in sunflower seeds can help lower blood pressure and help reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, but only if you eat them unsalted.\nBecause of their high levels of antioxidants, other nutrients, and specific chemo-preventive compounds, sunflower seeds can help prevent cancer and tumor growth.\nThe antioxidants in sunflower seeds are important for slowing the growth of mutated cancer cells and promoting DNA repair.\nResearch has found that the antioxidant gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E) in sunflower seeds can help in cancer prevention.\nThe selenium in sunflower seeds is another important antioxidant for breast cancer prevention.\nResearch even shows that selenium can help with DNA repair and detoxify the body of damaged cells.\nSince sunflower seeds are very high in selenium, just a handful daily can benefit your body.\nOne of the more peculiar health benefits of sunflower seeds is how they can help calm nerves and anxiety, and help reduce the pain associated with migraines.\nSunflower seeds are high in fiber, and as a result, can help with constipation.\nThe magnesium content in sunflower seeds can help improve overall mental health.\nThe vitamin E found in sunflower seeds can protect the skin from oxidative damage caused by environmental exposure and can support the growth of healthy, new skin cells.\nThe seeds can potentially help reduce osteoporosis symptoms, including a stooped posture, backaches, and bones that break easily.\nThe high amount of magnesium in sunflower seeds plays an important role in bone health.\nMagnesium helps keep the skeletal structure healthy, and this is important for preventing bone mineral density loss in osteoporosis.\nA diet high in nuts and seeds has been found to balance blood sugar levels and reduce hyperglycemia.\nThe many nutrients in sunflower seeds help mitigate the complications of blood sugar imbalance that often result from an unhealthy diet.\nSunflower seeds contain a lot of protein, and protein contains amino acids like tryptophan, which can help boost your mood.\nEating foods high in tryptophan like sunflower seeds can improve mood and benefit social behavior.\nSunflower seeds are incredibly good for us and provide many nutritional benefits, but like everything else in life, they do need to be eaten in moderation.\nThe seeds are high in fat, and even though they are sources of good fat, they can still lead to weight gain if you have too many of them, regardless of how beneficial they may be for you.\nSunflower seeds are loaded with nutrients, such as vitamin E, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, manganese, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium.\nAs a result, sunflower seeds can potentially help treat heart problems, promote sleep, improve your mood, protect against diabetes, support thyroid function, benefit bone health, improve male fertility, calm the nerves, prevent cancer, and more."

        "1": "The story came from a talk given by Dr. Graham McAuliffe of the Rothamsted Institute, who spoke at the National Farmers Union this week explaining that his unpublished research on tofu suggests that it could have a more drastic impact on the planet than beef, pork, and chicken.\n“Without a doubt, peas and groundnuts always have a lower environmental impact than any livestock products,” said McAuliffe, “But if you look at tofu, which is processed so there is more energy going into its production, when you correct for the fact that the protein in it is not as digestible compared to the meat-based products, you can see that it could actually have a higher global warming potential than any of the monogastric animals.” Monogastric animals only have one stomach (the clue is in the name) like us, horses, rabbits, rats, dogs, and pigs.\nPoore’s study, which attracted much praise from fellow scientists, shows how catastrophic the environmental impact of meat and dairy foods are compared to plant foods – including tofu – see Poore’s graph here or the BBC’s simple diagram here.\nTofu is a traditional food made by coagulating soya milk and pressing the curds into a block – a very similar process is used to make cheese in fact; so does the NFU say cheese is a processed food to be avoided for the sake of the environment?\nTofu is a low-fat great source of protein and should not be considered an ultra-processed food.\nTargeting tofu as an environmental villain is ludicrous given that so much of the devastating deforestation in the Amazon is being done to grow soya for animal feed so that people can eat meat.\nIf you care about the environment, you should ditch meat and eat more tofu!",
        "2": "A longtime staple of vegetarian diets – and of course, Thai and Chinese cooking – tofu is now sparking debate as the world wakes up to the environmental impact of their food.\nSpeaking at the National Farmers Union conference in London, Dr Graham McAuliffe from the Rothamsted Institute referenced yet to be published research that suggests tofu may have a bigger impact on climate change than some meats.\n“It’s important to recognise that the vast majority of foods, plant-based or not, are going to have an impact on the environment.\nEver-growing lists of reports have suggested eating less meat is key to reducing our environmental impact on the planet, with the United Nations, the University of Oxford and the Government’s own Committee on Climate Change coming to this conclusion.\n“More than 25% of global emissions come from food, and over half of this comes from animal products,” Andrew Stephen, CEO of the Sustainable Restaurant Association, tells HuffPost UK.\nBut a major contributor to the environmental cost of meat is the food the animals themselves consume, which regularly includes soybean animal feed.\nTofu is made by curdling soya milk taken from soybeans, which is why some critics argue that it’s not a sustainable alternative to meat.\n“Many involved in the meat industry would like to blame tofu for soya demand and deforestation, but the reality is that the vast majority of soya production is still used to feed farmed animals,” says Turner.\n“Reports from groups such as the Environmental Working Group have illustrated that the greenhouse gas emissions created by 1kg of tofu are far less than that of meats.” The main reason for confusion around tofu’s eco-credentials compared to meat is because production methods and supply chains for both vary a lot, says Stephen.\nUncertified South American soy can come with a heavy environmental cost.” For now, most soya in the world is consumed by livestock.\n“While there are better plant-based options for the environment than tofu, eating a vegan diet is still the best thing you can do to reduce your environmental footprint,” says Turner."

        "1": "There are different types of tofu, determined by the firmness and water content.\nThe more firm, the less water content, and therefore, the more calories and nutrients.\nThe more liquid varieties, like silken and soft tofu, have more water in it, and fewer calories, carbs, protein, and fat.\nThe following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for a one-quarter cup (or 81 grams) of firm tofu.1﻿ Tofu is a low carbohydrate food.\nA typical serving of firm tofu is 1/5 of a package or 79 grams.\nThis contains around 2 grams of carbohydrates and 2 grams of fiber.1﻿ Although one serving of firm tofu contains around 7 grams of fat, most of the fat is heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats and to a lesser degree monounsaturated fat.2﻿ Tofu is an excellent source of protein, with 14 grams per serving.\nSince tofu is a complete protein (which means it contains 9 of the essential amino acids required by the diet) it can be used as a substitute in recipes that call for meat.\nMany people who don't eat meat use tofu as the main protein in a meal.\nThe link to osteoporosis prevention requires more long-term studies comparing isoflavone by itself to soy products as a whole because protein also contributes to bone health.6 The National Institutes of Health suggests that soy is safe for most people when used as a food or taken for a short time as a dietary supplement.\nThey recommend that women who are at risk for breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive conditions should discuss soy-containing dietary supplements with their health care providers before consuming them.7 Soy, the main ingredient in tofu, is one of the top food allergens in children and adults.\nPeople allergic to wheat, beans (legumes), milk or other food can have also have an allergic reaction to soy.\nCertain depression medications (MAOIs) may interact with fermented soy products due to their potentially high level of the amino acid tyramine.\nOne serving of firm tofu can contain between less than 1 mg to close to 5 mg, depending on how long it has been fermenting.\nPeople taking the blood thinner warfarin should use also avoid soy products because it affects the efficacy of the medication.\nTofu comes in four varieties, based on the water content.\nThe more firm, the less water, and the more calories and nutrients per serving.\nBefore preparing tofu, open the package, and drain the product.\nTofu, raw, firm, prepared with calcium sulphate.\nSoy and Health Update: Evaluation of the Clinical and Epidemiologic Literature.\nSoy Foods And Their Protein and Isoflavone Content.\nSoy foods and supplementation: a review of commonly perceived health benefits and risks.",

Eating leaner cuts of meats can cut your LDLs because you’re getting less cholesterol-raising saturated fat in every bite.\nBoth fruits are rich in pectin, another soluble fiber that helps lower LDLs. Other great pectin sources include apples and all types of berries.\nResearchers have found that this reduced LDL levels by 30 percent in people with type 2 diabetes."

Avoid planting outside until nighttime temperatures are consistently above 55 degrees.\n8. Avoid use of herbicides near plants.\nIf the above methods do not correct the problem, get a soil test, which will include a test for organic matter and pH.\nPlant tomatoes in a container.",

Better yet, look for pole-and-line caught fish, which has an even lower incidence of bycatch and bycatch mortality (source).\nYou can easily find eco-friendly fished skipjack using the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch site (or download the app, which is linked on the home page).\nThey are usually fished using the same methods as skipjack.\nOnly eat sustainably-fished yellowfin (pole-and-line caught, or at least fished without FADs) if you must.\nAlbacore tuna inhabit a wide range of temperate and tropical waters and are usually sold canned.\nAgain, it is probably best to avoid eating albacore tuna to due its conservation status.\nIf you must eat it, look for pole-and-line caught fish.\nBigeye tuna live in subtropical and tropical waters and are sold fresh or frozen.\nEating bigeye in any form, fished in any manner is bad for the environment.\nPacific Bluefin tuna are estimated to be at less than 3% of their population.\nOverall: If you like tuna, buy sustainably-caught skipjack.\nThus, if tuna go extinct, it’s not only possible but likely that populations of other species down their food chain swell and burst.",
        "1": "Eco-label initiatives and programmes like Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch, meant to help hungry diners quickly select sustainably caught seafood, have been gathering public support in recent years, says Brandi McKuin at the University of California Merced.\nWhile those guides are helpful, their standards focus mainly on fishing-based factors, like leaving enough fish in the ocean to avoid decimating the population, and reducing the number of accidently caught fish, or bycatch, McKuin says.\nBy combing through published papers, reports, and online catch databases, McKuin and her colleague Elliott Campbell determined that tuna vessels using more sustainable methods such as troll and pole line fishing or longline fishing consume about three to four times as much fuel as boats that employ a large net called a purse seine.\nThat’s because purse seining is more efficient, McKuin says – more fish can be gathered in a shorter amount of time – but it’s also less sustainable than selective methods because other species get swept into the net, too.",
        "2": "Some tuna is certified as sustainably caught by groups such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) that set standards for sustainable fishing.\nIn late August, several media outlets published stories about On the Hook, a new campaign by a consortium of retailers and academics who have taken issue with some fishing practices allowed by the MSC.\nSome of the tuna caught here carries the MSC’s blue label, identifying it as the best environmental choice for consumers.\nBut rewarding fishermen for their sustainable catch, while allowing them to fish unsustainably, dupes consumers into supporting companies that take part in bad behaviour.\nFishermen can use nets to catch free-swimming adult tuna and earn MSC certification for their catch.\nFishing on FADs is faster and less costly, but these devices are associated with high levels of bycatch, one of the main sustainability concerns in many fisheries.\nFishing on FADs does not earn MSC certification.\n“Compartmentalization” is a technique that allows the unsustainable portion of the fish to be separated on board the vessel from the sustainable portion.\nIt costs fishermen more to fish sustainably because they have to find the tuna, instead of waiting for it to come to the FAD.\nIf purse-seining tuna vessels need to subsidize their sustainable fishing with unsustainable practices, then MSC certification has not provided the incentive it set out to.\nMillions of tonnes of tuna have been fished from the waters of the Western and Central Pacific fishery.\nFor example, PNA countries used to extract between three per cent and six per cent of the value of tuna fishery in their waters.\nIt would like the MSC to delay the recertification   — authorized by the accreditation body in September     — of the PNA fishery until the compartmentalization practice has been addressed.\nFor example, the MSC could specify that to earn a certification, a boat cannot fish sustainably and unsustainably on the same fishing trip.\nIn fact, it is the same boats, the same fleet, the same companies that are fishing MSC-certified tuna and on FADs. My colleagues also worry that the campaign calls into question the credibility of the MSC label.\nIt is no longer clear that fish carrying the MSC label offer the best environmental choice.\nConsumers need to know that the waters are muddy, that seafood sustainability is a moving target, and that it is not easy to make the right choice when standing in the aisle at the supermarket.\nMore than anything, the MSC needs to take a good look at itself and remember what it is supposed to represent   — the best environmental choice   — not consumer confusion."

I keep a bag of nuts and dried fruit in my desk at work.\nPeanuts are much cheaper than tree nuts, but the amount of saturated fat gives me pause.\nI don’t know anything about the impacts of growing some of the more exotic nuts, like Brazil nuts, cashews, and hazelnuts.\nA. Dearest Adrian, Grist thanks its sponsors.\nCrunchy, healthy nuts plus chewy, healthy dried fruit plus … oh, I believe you’ve forgotten the most important ingredient in any trail mix: chocolate, of course!\nWe’ve dealt quite a bit with almonds and their water requirements here at Grist, and walnuts and pistachios raise the same issues, so for now let’s skip those.\nI’m not going to tell you to stop eating them altogether – it’s complicated, like most food issues – but it’s good to consider their water footprints all the same.\nPeanuts are packed with healthy fats too, and their sat fat levels are on par with other nuts, like pecans, cashews, and walnuts.\n(Of course, peanuts are technically legumes – but let’s not get too nutty with our sorting here.) And speaking of local, pecans are also grown right around the corner from you in the southern states, while sunflower seeds hail from the nation’s middle.\nBrazil nuts, grown in – wait for it – Brazil’s Amazon, actually support the rainforest because they don’t grow well without their natural, diverse ecosystem around them.\nCashews grow primarily in Vietnam, India, and northern Africa, but most are shipped to India for processing; there, workers shell the nuts by hand, sometimes exposing their skin to burns from the caustic oils inside.\nWhenever I tackle these food questions, I like to point people to the holy grail of eco-friendly eating: local farms, organic practices.\nYou’ll be able to enjoy the tastes of summer all year, likely save some cash, and know that your chomping supports neighborhood farmers.\nEven if you’re not up for that project, you can probably sniff out some dried local fruits at the market anyway.\nThese suggestions ought to give you plenty of permutations for your trail mix, so I do hope you find some recipes to your liking.\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent, media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate, justice, and solutions.\nYour support helps Grist reveal the under-reported connection between social justice and climate change.",

        "1": "A preliminary, small study in healthy adults showed that eating a walnut-rich meal prevented oxidative damage of “bad” LDL cholesterol after eating, whereas a refined-fat meal didn’t (3Trusted Source).\nWalnuts are an excellent source of antioxidants that can help fight oxidative damage in your body, including damage due to “bad” LDL cholesterol, which promotes atherosclerosis.\nWalnuts are significantly higher in omega-3 fat than any other nut, providing 2.5 grams per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving (6, 7Trusted Source).\nObservational studies have shown that each gram of ALA you eat per day lowers your risk of dying from heart disease by 10% (9Trusted Source).\nWalnuts are a good source of the plant form of omega-3 fat, which may help reduce heart disease risk.\nBeneficial bacteria in your gut convert ellagitannins to compounds called urolithins, which have been found to protect against inflammation (5Trusted Source).\nAn unhealthy composition of your microbiota can contribute to inflammation and disease in your gut and elsewhere in your body, increasing your risk of obesity, heart disease and cancer (12Trusted Source).\nWhen 194 healthy adults ate 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of walnuts every day for eight weeks, they had an increase in beneficial bacteria, compared to a period of not eating walnuts (13Trusted Source).\nThis included an increase in bacteria that produce butyrate, a fat that nourishes your gut and promotes gut health (14Trusted Source).\nThis promotes the health of your gut and may help reduce disease risk.\nTest-tube, animal and human observational studies suggest that eating walnuts may reduce your risk of certain cancers, including breast, prostate and colorectal cancers (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).\nMore human studies are needed to confirm the effects of eating walnuts on decreasing the risk of these and other cancers, as well as to clarify all the ways or mechanisms by which they may help.\nWe’ll send you our evidence-based tips on meal planning and nutrition Walnuts are calorie dense, but studies suggest that the energy absorbed from them is 21% lower than would be expected based on their nutrients (19Trusted Source).\nIn a well-controlled study in 10 obese people, drinking a smoothie made with about 1.75 ounces (48 grams) of walnuts once a day for five days decreased appetite and hunger, compared to a placebo drink equal in calories and nutrients (20Trusted Source).\nObservational studies suggest that one reason walnuts are linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes is that they help control weight.\nExcess weight increases your risk of high blood sugar and diabetes (21Trusted Source).\nIn a controlled study in 100 people with type 2 diabetes, consuming 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed walnut oil a day for 3 months, while continuing their usual diabetes medication and balanced diet, resulted in an 8% decrease in fasting blood sugar (22Trusted Source).\nEating walnuts may help control type 2 diabetes and reduce your risk of the disease, as the nut may help control your weight.\nSome studies suggest that eating walnuts may help lower blood pressure, including in people with high blood pressure and in healthy people when under stress.\nAmong other diets, the four-year PREDIMED study in about 7,500 adults at high risk of heart disease tested a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 1 ounce (28 grams) of mixed nuts daily, of which half were walnuts.\nAt the end of the study, people on the nut-enriched Mediterranean diet had a 0.65 mmHg greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) than people on a similar heart-healthy control diet who weren’t given nuts (25Trusted Source).\nThis suggests that nuts may slightly improve the blood pressure benefits of a heart-healthy diet.\nThis is important, as small differences in blood pressure are thought to have a big impact on your risk of heart disease death (25Trusted Source).\nSome studies suggest that eating 1 ounce (28 grams) of nuts daily, including walnuts, as part of a heart-healthy diet may help improve blood pressure.\nThough high in calories, walnuts are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, fats and plant compounds that may help support good physical functioning as you age (27Trusted Source).\nAnimal and test-tube studies found that the nutrients in walnuts, including polyunsaturated fat, polyphenols and vitamin E, may help reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in your brain (28Trusted Source).\nIn a 10-month study of Alzheimer’s disease, mice fed 6–9% of their calories as walnuts (equal to 1–1.5 ounces or 28–45 grams daily in people) had significant improvements in learning skills, memory and anxiety reduction, compared to a walnut-free control group (29Trusted Source).\nObservational studies in older adults have linked eating walnuts to better brain function, including faster processing speed, more mental flexibility and better memory (28Trusted Source).\nTypical Western diets — high in processed foods, sugar and refined grains — have been linked to reduced sperm function (30Trusted Source).\nWhen 117 healthy young men included 2.5 ounces (75 grams) of walnuts daily in their Western-style diet for three months, they had improved sperm shape, vitality and mobility, compared to men not eating nuts (31Trusted Source).\nAnimal research suggests that eating walnuts may help protect sperm by reducing oxidative damage in their membranes (30Trusted Source).\nFor example, in a recent study in 194 healthy adults, eating 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of walnuts daily for eight weeks produced a 5% decrease in total cholesterol, 5% decrease in LDL cholesterol and 5% decrease in triglycerides, compared to not eating walnuts (33Trusted Source).\nWhen elevated, apolipoprotein-B is a major risk factor for heart disease (33Trusted Source).\nA daily 1.5-ounce (43-gram) serving of walnuts may help lower harmful cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which contribute to heart disease risk.\nThis rich nutrient profile contributes to the many health benefits associated with walnuts, such as reduced inflammation and improved heart disease risk factors.\nScientists are still uncovering the many ways that walnuts’ fiber and plant compounds, including polyphenols, may interact with your gut microbiota and contribute to your health.\nNuts are packed full of beneficial nutrients that may reduce your risk of many diseases.",
        "2": "A 2020 study, published in the journal Nutrients, assessed the effects of walnut consumption on the omega-3 fatty acid profile of healthy adults over a four-week period.\nResearchers found that after a month of consuming a few ounces of walnuts daily, the subjects' omega-3 status improved.\nIn a six-week Penn State study of overweight adults with cardiovascular risk, the addition of walnuts to their diet enhanced beneficial gut bacteria linked to health benefits, including reduced blood pressure and total cholesterol.\nIn a 2019 study, published in Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers found that when study subjects ate whole walnuts, they experienced greater benefits than when they consumed a diet with a similar fatty acid profile without walnuts.\nEating walnuts may help slow cognitive decline in at-risk groups of older adults, according to a 2020 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\nIn the trial, women with breast lumps were randomly assigned to consume either two ounces of walnuts per day or no walnuts for two to three weeks prior to surgery.\nIn a small trail published in the journal Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism, subjects were given smoothies that either contained walnuts or no walnuts for five days, while living in a controlled clinical research center.\nThe largest clinical trial to date to analyzing the effects of nut consumption on sexual function in healthy men was published in the journal Nutrients in 2019.\nResearchers found that over 14 weeks, men who ate about two servings (two ounces) of a nut mixture daily as part of a Western-style diet experienced a significant increase in orgasmic function and sexual desire."

        "1": "Many of the policy responses to the climate change problem – consume less, regulate businesses, curb big oil and coal, restrict car use – feel more comfortable to those on the left than the right of the political spectrum.\nThis is the backdrop to the parliamentary science and technology select committee's inquiry into the communication of climate science, to which I gave evidence on Monday.\nThe thrust of many of their questions was \"what could the media be doing better to communicate the science?\" Don't confer scientific expertise on people who do not deserve it.\nWhile the precise impacts and timescale of climate change may be uncertain, the basic tenets are well-established science.\nAnd let's face it, climate science may be complex, but the Higgs boson is harder to grasp than global warming.\nThe elephant in the room at the parliamentary inquiry though has been that, consciously or not, there are people on all sides of the climate debate who argue backwards from a cultural or political position.\nAs a result, arguments about the science of climate change become a proxy for what is really a political argument.\nIt is perhaps understandable that some on the right have reacted strongly to what they perceive as a left-wing agenda masquerading as science.\nThe truth is that we don't need to return to the Stone Age, but all this has made it much harder to have a sensible discussion about policies to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.\nSo politicians of all stripes need to come up with a coherent response to the profound societal questions raised by climate change.\nSo I repeat the plea I made to the select committee for centre right politicians, thinkers and cultural figures to reclaim the climate change issue and talk about it in language their supporters will understand and warm to.",
        "2": "For optimum fruit production watermelon requires a long growing season with lots of warmth and sun, but some types of watermelon will also produce in cooler climates with shorter seasons.\nWatermelon plants love the heat, and need a long and warm growing season of at least 70 to 85 days, depending on the variety, to produce sweet fruit.\nWatermelon grows best in fertile, well-draining, sandy loam soils.\nMost soils benefit from incorporating a few inches of organic compost before planting, and perhaps some fertilizer as well.\nWatermelon plants need lots of space to grow and spread out.\nThey can also be grown vertically by training them up a trellis to produce a sort of \"watermelon tree,\" if you're short on space, but the vines and fruit will require support.\nAlthough the watermelon's deep root system makes it relatively drought-tolerant, the plant requires an abundance of water to produce healthy fruit.\nThis plant can easily develop fungal foliage problems, so if you must water overhead, do so in the morning so that the foliage has a chance to dry during the day."

And let us not forget that yogurt comes from milk.\nSo yogurt eaters will also get a dose of animal protein (about 9 grams per 6-ounce serving), plus several other nutrients found in dairy foods, like calcium, vitamin B-2, B-12, potassium, and magnesium.\nHere are five possible health benefits of having a yogurt a day: ''Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D,'' says Jeri Nieves, PhD, MS, director of bone density testing at New York’s Helen Hayes Hospital.\nCalcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass in people of all ages, although the results are not always consistent, says Nieves, also an assistant professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University.\nCurrently, 400 IU per day is considered an adequate intake of vitamin D for people ages 51-70, Nieves says.\nNieves believes that older people specifically can benefit from more vitamin D.\nMany dairy products, including some yogurts, are made with added vitamin D.\nFind out which brands have added vitamin D by checking out the table below, and by reading labels when you shop.\nAlthough most of the low-fat dairy consumed by the study subjects was as milk, Alvaro believes low-fat yogurt would likely have the same effect.\nA recent Taiwanese study looked at the effects of yogurt containing lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on 138 people with persistent H.\nIn a small study, seven diabetic women with chronic Candidal vaginitis consumed 6 ounces of frozen aspartame-sweetened yogurt per day (with or without active cultures).\nEven though most of the women had poor blood sugar control throughout the study, the vaginal pH (measure of acidity or basicity) of the group eating yogurt with active cultures dropped from 6.0 to 4.0 (normal pH is 4.0-4.5).\nThe women eating the yogurt without active cultures remained at pH 6.0.\n1.5 1.5 7.5 1.5 1.5 The other decision is whether you want artificial sweeteners (which are used in most ''light'' yogurts) or whether you’re OK with most of the calories coming from sugar.\nTo make sure your yogurt contains active cultures, check the label.\nMost brands will have a graphic that says ''live and active cultures.'' If you want to know which specific active cultures your yogurt contains, look to the label again.\nUnder the list of ingredients, many brands list the specific active cultures.\nThis particular yogurt contains the probiotic culture bifidus regularis, which works to regulate your digestive system.\nSome brands list 0% of the Daily Value for vitamin D; others have 20%.\n(See the table above.) Make the perfect snack by pairing high-protein yogurt with a high-fiber food like fruit (fresh or frozen) and/or a high-fiber breakfast cereal.\nCup for cup, light and low-fat yogurt is higher in protein and calcium than light ice cream.\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition,\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition, April 2006; vol 83: pp 864-869.\nJournal of the American Dietetic Association, April 2006; vol106, Issue 4:",
